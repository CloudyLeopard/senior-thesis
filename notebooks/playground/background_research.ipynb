      "President Trump would save about $11 million on his taxes, if the new Republican tax overhaul were applied to his 2005 tax return, a New York Times analysis has found. The savings would be a roughly 30 percent cut. He would also save another $4.4 million on his eventual estate tax bill.\n",
      "On Friday, President Trump signed the sweeping tax overhaul approved earlier this week by Congress, a package of cuts that would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy.\n",
      "The analysis is based in part on information from his 2005 federal tax return, the most recent available, publicly released in March by David Cay Johnston on the website DCReport.org . Breaking with decades of tradition by previous presidents, Mr. Trump has refused to make any of his tax returns public. The analysis compares what his tax burden would be under current law with what it would be under the new legislation.\n",
      "On Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: “In some ways, particularly on the personal side, the president will likely take a big hit.” Last month, Mr. Trump said he would be a “big loser” under the tax bill.\n",
      "In fact, high-income earners like Mr. Trump are likely to benefit disproportionately from the new law. Nearly 43 percent of the tax overhaul’s total benefits will flow to the top 5 percent of taxpayers, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.\n",
      "The estimated benefits for Mr. Trump, calculated with the help of Robert Willens, an accounting expert, provide a view into the basics of how much he’d save and why. To be sure, there are unknowns about Mr. Trump’s taxes, including the 2005 return: How much he paid in state and local income taxes, whether he still has deductible losses, whether he still owes alternative minimum taxes and how much income he is earning today. It also doesn’t take into account other new benefits in the tax bill, including the ability to take some faster deductions. All those could affect his income taxes under the new law.\n",
      "The Republican overhaul allows individuals to qualify for a significantly reduced tax rate of 29.6 percent on certain types of income received through partnerships and similar entities that pass through their tax obligations to their owners — including rent and royalties, both big sources of income for Mr. Trump. That is far lower than the top tax rate of 39.6 percent currently faced by high-income earners.\n",
      "Mr. Trump could save as much as $11 million on his taxes from income likely generated through such entities, compared with his tax burden under current law. (In 2005, much of his taxable income was offset by a $103.2 million write-down in business losses.) According to Mr. Trump’s most recent government ethics filing, at least $217 million in revenue last year was generated by limited liability companies, a popular form of pass-through entity, and possibly much more. It is not clear how the revenue disclosed in that form relates to income reported on a tax return.\n",
      "There is also uncertainty about precisely how much he will be able to take advantage of the provision, which contains restrictions based on the size of his company’s workforce and the value of the property he owns. According to an estimate by Bloomberg Billionaires Index in June, properties owned by Mr. Trump were worth about $3 billion.\n",
      "The provision to reduce the highest tax rate to 37 percent from 39.6 percent would save Mr. Trump a relatively small amount compared to the new, lower rate on pass-through income.\n",
      "Though it would not be reflected on his income tax return, the bill increases the exemption from the estate tax for a married couple from $11 million to $22 million. If his assets were transferred after his death under today’s rules, his estate would be taxed at about 40 percent. The bill’s increased exemption from the federal estate tax could save his family about $4.4 million, though it could still be subject to New York estate taxes.\n",
      "This line item presents the most ambiguity for Mr. Trump. He listed $17 million in itemized deductions in 2005. It is unclear how much, if any, of those deductions were for state and local income taxes or property taxes. That could be important because the Republican tax overhaul eliminates all but $10,000 in deductions for such taxes.\n",
      "In reality, it seems unlikely Mr. Trump would have paid more than $6 million or so in such state and local income taxes, since his adjusted gross income was just under $49 million. (He may have paid no state and local income taxes at all.) Instead, the bulk of his itemized deductions likely came from things like interest expenses related to his investments or charitable deductions, such as donating so-called conservation easements on his golf courses.\n",
      "In 2005, the alternative minimum tax accounted for about 85 percent of Mr. Trump’s overall income tax payment, or about $31.3 million. The so-called AMT is meant to prevent America’s wealthiest from using deductions to pay very low or no federal income tax. (Mr. Trump originally sought to repeal the tax altogether.) The fact that most of his income tax bill was paid under the alternative minimum tax means he probably received little or no benefit from deductions for local taxes, since such deductions are not permitted under the AMT. As a result, the loss of such deductions in the tax bill might not hurt Mr. Trump at all.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — Republicans’ release of a sweeping plan to rewrite the tax code has set off a scramble among Washington lobbyists and trade groups to protect valuable tax breaks and other long-ingrained provisions.\n",
      "The plan’s scant details make it hard to know what, exactly, is on the chopping block. But within hours of the plan’s unveiling on Wednesday, flash points emerged over measures that supporters said could hurt the housing market, raise borrowing costs and increase the tax burden on families in high-tax states.\n",
      "The response put Trump administration officials on the defensive as they embark on a campaign to sell the plan.\n",
      "“The lobbyists shouldn’t have input, but the people in Congress should have input, and we’ll be working with them closely as we turn this into a bill and get it to the president to sign this year,” Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said on Fox Business Network on Thursday.\n",
      "Opposition from the real estate industry was swift and vocal, with trade groups strongly criticizing elements of the plan that they say will make home-buying less attractive and weaken the housing market. While the plan specifically calls for preserving the mortgage interest deduction, real estate agents are warning that a proposal to double the standard deduction will make taxpayers less likely to itemize their tax returns and claim the mortgage deduction.\n",
      "The deduction is a key incentive for people to buy homes, since it reduces their taxable income by the amount of interest paid on a mortgage. Real estate agents worry that doubling the standard deduction may provide a richer tax break than itemizing and claiming the mortgage deduction.\n",
      "“We have always said that tax reform — a worthy endeavor — should first do no harm to homeowners,” said William E. Brown, president of the National Association of Realtors.\n",
      "A proposal to limit the deductibility of corporate interest has prompted jockeying among powerful groups that rely on debt to help finance their operations, including real estate companies, private equity firms, financial companies and other businesses.\n",
      "The Build Coalition, a group of associations from the telecommunications, manufacturing and agriculture industries that formed to protect the corporate interest provision, warned that Republicans would be acting counter to their promise to spur business investment by following through on the proposal. Businesses that rely heavily on debt to finance their investments will see costs go up, they say, driving down profitability, investment and job creation.\n",
      "“Altering that would make it more difficult for American companies to compete in the global economy and harm job creation and long-term economic growth,” said Mac O’Brien, a spokesman for the group. “Fortunately, the discussion on tax reform is far from over.”\n",
      "Similar concerns are emanating from Wall Street, with the American Bankers Association warning that a limitation on borrowers’ ability to deduct interest expenses could “adversely impact economic growth.”\n",
      "Republicans have only slightly tipped their hand as to the overall structure of the tax rewrite. The plan would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and create a new 25 percent tax rate for “pass through” businesses such as partnerships, sole proprietorships and family farms.\n",
      "It would also lower the top individual tax rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, while raising the bottom rate to 12 percent from 10 percent as it also doubles the standard deduction. The plan would eliminate many corporate “loopholes” and deductions, such as the state and local tax deduction. But it would also get rid of many provisions that are currently costly to the rich, like the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.\n",
      "The most politically fraught proposal is eliminating the state and local tax deduction, which allows taxpayers who itemize to write off their property, state and local taxes. The measure is particularly prized in blue states with high property taxes, but is also widely used in some Republican districts in Virginia, New Jersey and California.\n",
      "Eliminating the deduction, which the real estate industry also opposes, would save more than $1 trillion over a decade and make room for the tax cuts. But Republican members of Congress in affected states have already expressed concern about the provision, and a plan that repeals the deduction could be impossible to pass.\n",
      "“The state and local tax piece is very concerning, because we’re already a donor state to Washington, and this would exacerbate that problem,” said Representative John J. Faso, Republican of New York, referring to the amount the state pays in taxes. “And so I want to see — based on income categories — how a hypothetical family of four with a certain amount of income, with a $8,000 property tax and state income tax bill, how they are affected.”\n",
      "Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, also expressed doubt on Thursday that the deduction would die easily.\n",
      "The bill makes major changes to the tax code by lowering rates for individuals and corporations.\n",
      "“That’s been a long-heralded and expected set of tax rules, and it’s really, really tough to change that,” Mr. Hatch said.\n",
      "Changes to core components of the tax plan could force Republicans to slim down the size of the tax cuts.\n",
      "“Republicans from high-taxed states are, in our view, unlikely to go along with the elimination of the SALT deduction,” said Brian Gardner, an analyst at the investment banking company Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, referring to the state and local tax deduction. “Keeping the SALT deduction, or even merely reducing it, would ultimately result in smaller tax cuts or a larger budget deficit, which we think would be a tough sell to congressional budget hawks.”\n",
      "Preliminary estimates of the tax plan found that it could cost as much as $2.2 trillion over 10 years. Progressive groups are already warning that the cuts will disproportionately benefit the rich, and that changes to the standard deduction could end up raising, not lowering , taxes on middle-class families.\n",
      "“Our No. 1 concern is that this delivers massive, massive tax cuts to millionaires and corporations,” said Michael Linden, an adviser to the progressive Not One Penny campaign, which is fighting to make sure the tax overhaul is not a boon for the rich.\n",
      "The group, which includes liberal organizations such as MoveOn, Tax March and the Working Families Party, has already spent more than $1 million advertising in congressional districts across the country to urge lawmakers from both parties to oppose tax cuts for the rich, and it expects to become more active.\n",
      "“We’ll be ramping it up,” Mr. Linden added. “This campaign has been bubbling below the surface for the last several months, but now it’s going to take center stage.”\n",
      "For its part, the Trump administration is maintaining that surging economic growth produced by the tax cuts will prevent the plan from adding to the deficit, and that it will benefit middle-class families.\n",
      "However, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser acknowledged in an interview with ABC News that it was too soon to make promises. It remains possible that some middle-class families could see their tax bills increase under the plan.\n",
      "“There’s an exception to every rule,” said Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council. “I can’t guarantee anything. You can always find a unique family somewhere.”\n",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. — President Trump took his campaign for tax cuts to another key battleground state on Wednesday in search of elusive Democratic votes as he argued that his plan would benefit middle-class Americans, like truck drivers, more than it would help his fellow business tycoons.\n",
      "At a rally in an airport hangar reminiscent of his fiery events during last year’s presidential campaign, Mr. Trump told hundreds of truckers that slashing rates would produce more hauling contracts and put more money in their pockets. Uncertain that he can count on a fragile Republican majority during a critical Senate vote next week , he sought to pressure Pennsylvania’s Democratic senator to support the plan.\n",
      "“We’re going to fight, and we’re going to get those Republicans and maybe of few of those Democrats to raise their hand,” Mr. Trump told the cheering crowd. “And you’re going to have so much money to spend in this wonderful country and this great economy. That is why we have proposed tax cuts that are pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family and pro-American.”\n",
      "But if he hoped to turn Senator Bob Casey, the Democrat, Mr. Trump made little traction. In a statement, Mr. Casey called the president’s plan “a massive tax giveaway” to the richest Americans at the expense of the middle class.\n",
      "“It’s time for the administration and Congress to stop advocating for this scheme to cut taxes for the superrich and focus on raising wages and creating good-paying jobs for our families in Pennsylvania,” Mr. Casey said.\n",
      "The short trip to the Pennsylvania state capital underscored the complicated politics of the tax fight for the president. The 52-vote Republican majority may not be enough next week to secure a budget measure needed for the tax cuts, given that some of that party’s senators are balking or on the fence. Mr. Trump has been hunting for Democrats without any certain converts.\n",
      "In addressing truck drivers, Mr. Trump sought to dispel the impression that his plan was tilted to wealthy people like him. “It’s a middle-class bill,” he said. “That’s what I want.”\n",
      "He added: “I’ve had rich friends of mine come up to me and say, ‘Donald, you’re doing this tax plan — we don’t want anything. We don’t.’ Now, they gain when the economy gains. They gain when companies get better. They gain in lots of different ways. But they don’t want that. So many people have come up to me and say, ‘Give it to the middle class. Give it to people that need it. Give it to people that want to spend it.’”\n",
      "The White House argued that truckers would benefit because many own their own businesses and pay through individual tax rates that would be slashed to 20 percent. They would also benefit by the elimination of the estate tax when they try to leave their businesses to their children.\n",
      "But the vast majority of truckers would not be affected by the change in so-called pass-through business taxes. Rough estimates from trucking associations show that there are 3.5 million truckers in the United States and 350,000 owner-operators, meaning about one in 10 truckers is self-employed.\n",
      "Moreover, the estate tax applies only to estates over $5.49 million for individuals, or about $11 million for couples. At a median income of $41,340, the average truck driver would have to have no expenses for 133 years to amass an estate large enough to be subject to taxation.\n",
      "But Republicans said Democrats were tilting the debate for political reasons. Bob Paduchik, a chairman of the Republican National Committee, accused Mr. Casey of flip-flopping from his past support for tax cuts.\n",
      "“Putting this type of blind partisanship ahead of the needs of families and business owners suffering under our nation’s tax burden is irresponsible and unacceptable,” Mr. Paduchik said.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — President Trump’s proposal to slash individual and business taxes and erase a surtax that funds the Affordable Care Act would amount to a multitrillion-dollar shift from federal coffers to America’s richest families and their heirs, setting up a politically fraught battle over how best to use the government’s already strained resources.\n",
      "The outline that Mr. Trump offered on Wednesday — less a tax overhaul plan than a list of costly cuts with no price tags attached, rushed out by a president staring down his 100-day mark in office — calls for tax reductions for individuals of every income level as well as businesses large and small.\n",
      "But the vast majority of benefits would accrue to the highest earners and largest holders of wealth, according to economists and analysts, accounting for a lopsided portion of the proposal’s costs.\n",
      "“The only Americans who are very clear winners under the new system are the wealthiest,” said Edward D. Kleinbard , a law professor at the University of Southern California and former chief of staff of Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation , which estimates the revenue effects of tax proposals.\n",
      "Repealing the estate tax, for example, would affect just 5,300 or so fortunes a year. For 2017, couples can shield up to $11 million of their estates from any taxation, leaving only the largest inheritances subject to taxation. Repealing the estate tax alone would cost an estimated $174.2 billion over a decade, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said .\n",
      "Reducing the rate on capital gains, noncorporate business taxes and those in the highest bracket, as well as repealing the alternative minimum tax, would also ease the burden on wealthier Americans. So would the repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s 3.8 percent surtax on the investment income of high earners, put in place to subsidize health coverage for low-income Americans.\n",
      "“These are all afflictions of the affluent,” Mr. Kleinbard said.\n",
      "There is no way to know how the mathematics of the proposal would work, since the White House offered no cost estimates, no detail about which incomes would be taxed at what levels and no information about tax deductions or other breaks that might be eliminated to make up for the lost revenue.\n",
      "On Thursday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, suggested that tax benefits for retirement savings would be rolled back to mitigate the cost of the tax cuts, the kind of tough decision that makes a rewrite of the tax code so politically difficult. But within minutes, White House officials said Mr. Spicer had misspoken.\n",
      "Officials instead said specifics would come later, as negotiations unfolded with members of Congress to draft legislation.\n",
      "The administration’s silence on many crucial details of the proposal was by design, to leave room for what promise to be intense negotiations with lawmakers in Congress, said Rohit Kumar, the leader of PwC’s Washington National Tax Services and a former senior Republican Senate aide.\n",
      "Yet without specifics, he added, “you can’t make anything but a wild guess on what the distributional effects of the proposal would be.”\n",
      "“What the administration put out yesterday is all of the good news,” Mr. Kumar said. “They’ve withheld on the bad news.”\n",
      "But estimates of the impacts for some of the cuts that were outlined Wednesday, such as the estate tax and alternative minimum tax repeals, can be made, and they run directly counter to the populist themes that animated Mr. Trump’s campaign. He has often stated his concern for ordinary working men and women who he contends were forgotten under previous administrations but have risen to the top of the priority list under his leadership.\n",
      "Many economists who analyzed a similar plan Mr. Trump proposed during his presidential campaign found that it would have disproportionately helped the richest. William G. Gale, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, estimated that just over 50 percent of the benefits of that proposal would have gone to the top 1 percent of taxpayers.\n",
      "The new proposal “loses probably something in the neighborhood of $5 trillion in revenue over 10 years with regressive tax cuts that exacerbate the inequalities that already exist in our economy,” said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who was a top economist in the Obama administration.\n",
      "Mr. Trump’s economic team argues that there is no disconnect; the tax reductions they are seeking, they argue, will ultimately help all Americans, including the poorest, by spurring growth that will translate into more jobs and better wages.\n",
      "Still, it seems almost inevitable that the blueprint, should it eventually yield legislation, would violate the vow Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, made that the administration would provide “no absolute tax cut for the upper class.”\n",
      "That axiom, uttered by Mr. Mnuchin in November and quickly named the “Mnuchin rule” by skeptical Democrats, was based on his insistence that any tax reductions at the top would be matched by the elimination of deductions and loopholes.\n",
      "“It is hard to know what the overall effects would be, but a plan that is intended to reduce taxes on business income and investment income is going to provide substantial benefits to wealthier individuals, and the bulk of the benefits in this plan would go to them,” said Ed Lorenzen, a senior adviser for the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal policy education group. “It would probably work out to be a significant shift in the distribution of the tax code.”\n",
      "Want to know how the proposed tax plan will affect you? Answer these questions to find out.\n",
      "One major reason is Mr. Trump’s idea to allow the income of owner-operated companies, including his real estate concern, hedge funds and large partnerships, to be taxed at a 15 percent rate — the same rate corporations would pay under his plan — rather than at the individual income tax rate, which now tops out at 39.6 percent and would be set at 35 percent by Mr. Trump.\n",
      "That would potentially allow doctors, lawyers and others who are part of such firms to structure their compensation as business rather than personal income and effectively enjoy a substantial tax cut. The Tax Policy Center estimated last year that the proposal would cost $1.5 trillion over a decade.\n",
      "Higher earners also appear likely to reap the greatest benefit from repealing the alternative minimum tax, which is set at a marginal rate of 28 percent and falls most heavily on those who earn between $250,000 and $1 million. In 2013, President Barack Obama and Congress reached agreement on a “fix” that shielded middle-class families from the tax. So any repeal now would benefit wealthier taxpayers.\n",
      "Only a fifth of taxpayers who earn above $1 million were affected by the provision, a parallel tax system that limits the deductions and other tax breaks available to them, in part because interest and investment income are exempt.\n",
      "A glimpse of Mr. Trump’s 2005 tax returns revealed that the alternative minimum tax cost him roughly $31 million by setting a floor that even a stack of individual loopholes could not reduce. Repealing it would cost $412.8 billion over a decade, the Tax Policy Center has estimated.\n",
      "At the same time, lower- and middle-income families could be in a worse position. The White House proposes to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three: 10, 25 and 35 percent. But no one yet knows where the income cutoff lines are being drawn. People who end up being pushed into a lower bracket would be better off, but those kicked into a higher bracket would not be.\n",
      "Families with after-tax income between roughly $19,000 and $76,000, for example, are now in the 15 percent marginal tax bracket, which is slated for elimination.\n",
      "“That’s where the middle of America is,” Mr. Kleinbard said. While some may drop into the new 10 percent bracket, others could be nudged up into the 25 percent range.\n",
      "Increasing the standard deduction to about $24,000 for couples might also appear to help most families, but that is not necessarily the case, Mr. Kleinbard pointed out. Larger families, which now benefit from being able to add a deduction for every additional member of their household, could lose out.\n",
      "“At the bottom end, the typical family will be worse off if personal exemptions go away,” he said.\n",

      "Three scenarios for how Republicans could approach cutting taxes next year.\n",
      "By Andrew Duehren\n",
      "Nothing unifies Republicans like cutting taxes.\n",
      "Still, determining which taxes to cut — and how deeply to cut them — can be an ordeal. With Republicans on track for total control of Washington next year, they’ll have to work through several contentious questions before they can pass another tax cut.\n",
      "The most important issue will be the cost of the legislation. Some Republicans worry about cutting taxes too much and blowing up the deficit. Others believe tax cuts juice the economy and are worth the consequences. Plenty of Republicans think Americans should keep more of the money they earn.\n",
      "In today’s newsletter, I’ll walk through three scenarios for how Republicans could approach cutting taxes next year.\n",
      "In 2017, President Donald Trump signed a major tax cut. To contain its cost, Republicans scheduled many of the provisions to expire after 2025, betting that a future Congress would continue them.\n",
      "That gamble looks as if it will pay off. Republicans generally agree that the law’s biggest provisions — including lower income-tax rates, a larger standard deduction and lower taxes for many businesses — should not end next year.\n",
      "Even doing this much will be expensive. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that extending all of the expiring tax provisions will cost $4.6 trillion over a decade, including additional borrowing costs. The federal government is already expected to borrow roughly $22 trillion over that time frame, bringing the debt to a level many economists find alarming.\n",
      "Republicans have floated some spending cuts, like ending subsidies for clean-energy industries, to offset that cost. But savings from the proposed reductions would still fall short of covering the cost of continuing the 2017 tax law. Plus, many of the potential spending cuts are opposed by some Republicans.\n",
      "One scenario is that Republicans, struggling to agree to broader changes, simply extend the 2017 law and keep the tax code the way it is now. An extension might even expire in just a few years to hold down the price.\n",
      "In his campaign, Trump proposed several new tax cuts. He said that tips and overtime pay shouldn’t be taxed, for instance, and that domestic manufacturers should pay lower taxes. He also proposed reversing one of the few tax increases in the 2017 law, which limited deductions for state and local taxes — a provision that especially affected wealthy people in blue states.\n",
      "Congressional Republicans kept their distance from those ideas. If they embraced them now, it would add to the cost of the legislation.\n",
      "The exact design of these tax cuts will be important. By one definition of “tip,” many Americans could reclassify their earnings to avoid taxes. Alternately, the provision could apply only to lower-income workers who now make much of their money in tips.\n",
      "Trump aides are looking for ways to limit the cost of these moves. One possibility is that Republicans pass limited versions of these ideas — like increasing, but not eliminating, the cap for the state and local deduction. Doing so would still raise the cost of the bill but by a smaller amount than broader interpretations of Trump’s pledges.\n",
      "Then there’s the possibility that Trump persuades Republicans in Congress to carry out the entire fiscal agenda he outlined during the campaign — and potentially take things even further. That could mean deeper tax cuts for corporations, as well as the end of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which includes funding for both clean energy and the Internal Revenue Service.\n",
      "Perhaps the most significant change would be a tariff Trump has proposed for all imported goods. Republicans are discussing whether to pass such a tariff into law, though Trump could also likely enact it with executive authority. That tariff could help pay for the tax cuts, but they probably wouldn’t raise enough to fully offset the cost.\n",
      "Passing a tariff into law would make it impossible for a future president to remove them without help from Congress. It would also mark a fundamental change in fiscal policy in the United States. American policymakers have not treated tariffs as a way to generate revenue for the federal government in almost a century.\n",
      "A new tax cut is almost assured next year. Any additional economic growth created by lower taxes could help many Americans. But the biggest winners will likely be the rich, who pay more tax and therefore reap the biggest benefits from tax cuts. The losers could be the low-income Americans who face higher costs on everyday goods because of tariffs.\n",
      "Americans may also suffer in the future. They may have to pay higher taxes or collect smaller benefits from programs like Social Security to help fix the nation’s fiscal problems.\n",
      "Today’s newsletter is the second installment in a running series on the Trump agenda. The first included an annotated list of policies he’s likely to change .\n",
      "Trump picked Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services . Kennedy has spread conspiracy theories and falsehoods about vaccines causing autism.\n",
      "Kennedy, an environmental lawyer with no training in medicine or public health, would oversee the F.D.A., C.D.C., Medicare and Medicaid .\n",
      "He would also oversee the National Institutes of Health, which studies diseases.\n",
      "Kennedy has also been outspoken about the dangers of ultraprocessed foods .\n",
      "He has said that the government has been too aggressive in regulating raw milk, psychedelics, hydroxychloroquine and more.\n",
      "Late-night hosts joked about the pick .\n",
      "Lawmakers from both parties want to see the House Ethics Committee report on Matt Gaetz , Trump’s nominee for attorney general, over allegations of sexual misconduct and drug use. The Republican who leads the committee suggested that he would not release the report.\n",
      "Trump decided to nominate Gaetz while the two men flew from Washington to West Palm Beach this week.\n",
      "Gaetz’s nomination rattled Justice Department and F.B.I. officials , whom Trump has vowed to punish. Steve Bannon, a Trump ally, urged Gaetz to prosecute MSNBC hosts, producers and guests if he’s confirmed.\n",
      "Trump picked his defense lawyer to be the Justice Department’s No. 2 official .\n",
      "Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota who ran for president this year, is Trump’s pick to lead the Interior Department. Burgum, who is close to fossil fuel executives, will most likely help to open federal lands and waters to drilling .\n",
      "Two Republican senators — Joni Ernst of Iowa and Todd Young of Indiana — sounded skeptical about the nomination of Pete Hegseth , the Fox News host Trump picked to be his defense secretary.\n",
      "Senate Republicans are split on whether to recess the chamber to let Trump appoint officials without their votes , as he has requested.\n",
