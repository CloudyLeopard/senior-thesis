AI-Semiconductor & Hardware Valuation
1. AI Infrastructure Spending Resilient Despite Market Pullback
Contributing Analysts Jake Silverman (Technology)
(Bloomberg Intelligence) -- AI semiconductor stocks have pulled
back sharply, but fundamentals suggest this is more of a valuation
reset than a structural decline. Hyperscaler AI capital spending
continues to rise, supporting demand for GPUs, custom ASICs and
networking products, even as margin forecasts face compression.
Meanwhile, AI-hardware vendors and networking chipmakers are
navigating near-term uncertainty from tariﬀs and product cycles but remain positioned for long-
term growth. Small- and midcap AI semis have faced multiple compression on capex and economic
fears, though earnings outlooks remain stable. If AI infrastructure spending sustains its
momentum, these segments could post a strong recovery. (03/20/25)

AI-Chip Valuations
AI Semi Stocks' Retreat Seems More Recalibration Than Breakdown
Contributing Analysts Oscar Hernandez Tejada (Technology)
AI semiconductor stocks' sharp pullback may be driven more by a recalibration than a structural
decline, with rising hyperscaler spending fueling demand for GPUs, custom ASICs and networking
solutions raising revenue consensus for AI-chip makers, despite margin pressure and competitive
shifts. Though valuations have compressed, AI infrastructure spending remains strong, positioning
the sector for long-term growth. (03/17/25)
2. Fundamentals Check – Has Anything Changed?
Contributing Analysts Oscar Hernandez Tejada (Technology)
AI compute chipmakers' revenue consensus in the past six months indicates rising projections as
GPU, custom compute and AI network-demand continues to climb. Some outliers like Intel, AMD
and Nvidia's Data Center networking show declines due to market-share loss (Intel, Inﬁniband) and
company-speciﬁc growth issues (Intel, AMD) rather than end-market weakness. Custom compute
and networking participants like Broadcom, Marvell and Astera Labs have seen signiﬁcant upward
revisions, reﬂecting hyperscaler AI investment beyond GPUs.
Though some AI-spending headwinds exist (including DeepSeek, trade restrictions and tariﬀs), data
suggests these haven't aﬀected estimates on a quantitative level, but have impacted those
valuations driven by qualitative perspectives. (03/17/25)

AI Segment Revenue Forecast (6 mo ago vs. today)
3. Valuation Reset – Cheap or Justiﬁed?
Contributing Analysts Oscar Hernandez Tejada (Technology)
P/E multiples for AI peers were trading at a 100% premium to SOX (39x vs. 17x), before narrowing
to 57% (27x vs. 17x). Previously, names like Astera Labs (82x), ARM (51x) and Marvell (29x)
commanded hefty valuation premiums, but these have signiﬁcantly retreated. Nvidia's has fallen to
20x from 25x, Marvell's has dropped to 19x vs. 31x, and AMD now trades at just 16-17x.
Though AI fundamentals remain strong with revenue estimates boosted for Nvidia, Broadcom and
others, margin projections have been cut, largely due to company-speciﬁc headwinds rather than
economic weakness. The compression appears more tied to geopolitical risk and near-term
uncertainty than a deterioration in AI demand. If fundamentals remain strong and AI capex
continues rising, this could just be a near-term correction. (03/17/25)

Bloomberg® 03/21/2025 15:23:59
A recent downturn in fundamentals and corresponding semiconductor-valuation contractions
provide a framework for possible recessionary scenarios and implications for current multiples, our
analysis suggests. Though the computing semis outlook doesn't suggest a fundamental
recessionary downturn, the recent valuation contraction (minus 26% 2024 peak to YTD 2025)
suggests concerns about being priced in. A current SOX multiple of 17x -- at ﬁve-year average
levels -- suggests a limited downside scenario, unless 2025-26 fundamentals get readjusted
signiﬁcantly (about 15% below 2024's sales levels).
Despite volatility, computing semiconductor revenue (driven by AI) is projected to grow at a 9.5%
CAGR, reinforcing long-term demand. (03/17/25)
Computing Sales Forecast & SOX PE Compression
5. AI Compute Companies Face Margin Compression
Contributing Analysts Oscar Hernandez Tejada (Technology)
Gross-margin estimates for AI compute companies have been pared for calendar 2025-26, with
Nvidia, AMD and Intel's declines largely driven by new product ramp-ups and supply-chain costs.
Nvidia's Blackwell and AMD's MI300x -- both new oﬀerings -- are fueling near-term margin
weakness, while Intel faces more rivalry and higher manufacturing costs. Marvell's drop is driven
by its custom-silicon push, which is a gross-margin headwind but may boost operating margin
longer term as hyperscalers shift toward custom AI silicon. Networking and ASIC companies like
Broadcom and Astera Labs are expanding proﬁtability on rising average selling prices and content.
Despite this, AI peers still lead the semi industry, with a 2025 consensus gross margin of 73%, on
average, vs. the SOX at around 50%, underscoring AI’s premium positioning. (03/17/25)

AI Peers Gross Margin Forecast (6 mo ago vs Today)
6. 2025-26 View – AI-Spending Outlook
Contributing Analysts Oscar Hernandez Tejada (Technology)
Despite concerns around DeepSeek and fears of a slowdown, AI demand keeps rising, with
hyperscalers aggressively increasing capex. In the past year, Microsoft, Meta, AWS and Google
have all made major AI investments, with 2025-26 capex forecasts up sharply. Though a slowing
economy could hurt spending, past cycles suggest hyperscalers adjust selectively rather than
retreat entirely. Additionally, the DeepSeek fallout may push hyperscalers to invest more in custom
silicon for reasoning-based models, which could further beneﬁt Broadcom, Marvell and networking
providers like Astera Labs.
Competition is increasing for Nvidia but so will overall demand given AI spending is no longer
discretionary but a fundamental pillar of cloud growth, and despite external pressures, AI capex
will accelerate, not slow in the next two years. (03/17/25)

Fears of hyperscaler capital spending cuts and economic weakness have reduced valuations for

7. AI Chip Valuations, Fundamentals Diverge
Contributing Analysts Jake Silverman (Technology)
Consensus for 2026 earnings of small- and midcap chipmakers for AI and networking have been
about ﬂat on average for the past three months after being up 16% for the past six months. Yet
returns dropped 29% over the past three months and rose 21% over the past six, suggesting that
fundamentals and valuations have decoupled on concerns over DeepSeek, capex cuts by AI
hyperscalers and an uncertain 2025 economy that could pressure IT expenditures. Assuming that
2025 hyperscaler spending doesn't decline and grows even modestly next year, small- and midcap
semiconductor earnings could continue to climb.
Fundamentals for companies including Credo, Astera Labs, Coherent and Lumentum have
increased recently. Semtech is an outlier, as an architectural change at Meta sent estimates lower.

8. Smaller Multiples Tie to Data Center Exposure
Contributing Analysts Jake Silverman (Technology)
Sales growth for AI and networking chipmakers could remain strong as infrastructure expansion
requires more GPUs and AI clusters, and might be agnostic regarding which particular chips
hyperscalers or AI clouds use. Revaluation of small- and midcaps exposed to data centers has likely
hinged on fears that capital spending will be cut by hyperscalers. They had been driving robust
revenue growth for AI networking chips, spurring premium valuations that are now being tested.
Multiples have contracted for companies with data center exposure above 20%. Micron’s valuation
has expanded slightly as memory spot prices have stabilized and customer inventories have
improved. (03/19/25)

9. Memory Stocks Remain Uncorrelated Spot Pricing
Contributing Analysts Jake Silverman (Technology)
Earnings revisions for two top memory suppliers, Micron and SK Hynix, have diverged, likely
because the latter's heavier exposure to high-bandwidth memory shields it somewhat from weak
NAND trends. Though data center exposure for memory suppliers has increased amid growing HBM
and LPDDR5 demand for AI servers, Micron's still nascent HBM sales left it vulnerable to recent
memory cycles as excess inventory built up at PC and smartphone customers. Neither company's
shares have been highly correlated to spot pricing in the past year, suggesting that secular trends
such as HBM have been important catalysts for stocks.
That said, near-term stabilization of NAND and DRAM spot prices have likely driven recent stock
movements for Micron, Sandisk and SK Hynix. (03/19/25)
Spot Pricing, Earnings Revisions
Hardware, Networking PE's
Hardware, Networking AI Premium Derisked After Valuation Reset
Arista, Dell, Celestica and US AI-hardware and networking peers' share retreat may have addressed
intermediate AI spending concerns. Forward price-to-earnings for 2026 fell 20-30% for the group
from Jan. 6's peak to a 14.6x average, consistent with the 3-5 year equivalent prior to 2024's AI
spike, but the outlook remains intact. Fundamentals are poised to ramp up in 2H and into 2026,
and may drive better earnings growth. (03/20/25)
10. AI No Longer a Premium Following PE Reset
Shares of US hardware and networking companies with meaningful AI exposure have dropped 21%,
on average, since Nvidia's peak valuation on Jan. 6, or "peak AI." Non-AI issues exist, such as HPE's
poor operational execution in its server business and the potential for fallout from tariﬀs on
hardware margin and earnings. But in many cases, concerns about intermediate-term AI-
infrastructure spending have sharply lowered the appetite for risk, narrowing group valuations.
The concerns may lie more on the durability of 2026 expectations, as P/E plus two years has fallen
20-30% for the group to a 14.6x average. The current PE plus two years is largely consistent with
the three-year and ﬁve-year averages for the group, implying much of the valuation related to the
AI opportunity has been erased. (03/20/25)

12. Networking Steady; AI Demand Could Still Drive EPS
The underlying fundamental drivers for AI networking remain robust, which has supported a steady
stream of upward revisions to Arista's and Celestica's 2025-26 EPS consensus, while Ciena raised
its three-year growth proﬁle to 8-11% from 5-8%. But the ramp-up may be more 2H-loaded and is
dependent on the timing or readiness of other pieces of the AI data center, such as the GPU,
cooling or the physical structure.
The steady planned increase in the number of 100,000 GPU clusters, plus Nvidia’s GPU updated
product roadmap at the GTC conference, led by the Rubin chip and NVL144, are encouraging signs
that the demand for network capacity will only go up in terms of volume and higher-priced gear,
which would only support further EPS gains. (03/20/25)

AI Networking Forward EPS vs. Share Price
13. Hardware’s Non-AI Tariﬀ Issue Compounds Weak AI Margin
In contrast, recession and tariﬀ fears compound weak AI-server margins for traditional IT vendors
Dell and HPE, which has driven the recent slide in valuations. Though we expect AI-server sales to
increase in 2H, along with the Blackwell GPU ramp-up, margin expansion and EPS growth may be
more reliant on improved corporate-IT spending and whether companies can work around tariﬀs.
Leading AI-server providers Dell and Super Micro are likely to remain aggressive in pursuing large
AI deals, which could keep AI-server margin tempered through 2026. But with the Blackwell
product cycle in full swing, companies will be exposed to more 10-ﬁgure deals vs. 2025, and
sentiment may be driven more by the lift in operating income and the impact on proﬁt vs. margin.

14. Large Deals, Client Concentration Are AI Fact of Life
Customer concentration and exposure to large deals are unavoidable for server and networking
companies since hyperscale-cloud providers and emerging prominent neocloud vendors, such as
xAI, OpenAI and Coreweave are driving much of the AI-infrastructure demand. We acknowledge
that the onus is on company management to reliably provide sales guidance, but deals slip or are
delayed for numerous reasons, and one dropped transaction raises companies' quarterly sales-
execution risk proﬁle.
Displacement risks exist, especially with networkers. But we believe providers with leading edge,
diﬀerentiated technologies, or with deep implementation and services expertise, should continue
to navigate the rapidly shifting technology landscape. (03/20/25)

However, the generative AI build-out remains in the early stages, and there’s little evidence that
hyperscale and neo-cloud providers or sovereign entities are scaling back planned 2025-27 AI
data-center investments, which we think would trigger estimate cuts. Though tariﬀs may weigh
more on networking vendors than AI servers, Arista and Celestica have resilience and ﬂexibility in
their supply chains to help mitigate the risk. (03/19/25)
BI Hardware/Networking 1H25 AI Impact Matrix
16. AI Data-Center Plans Suggest Fundamentals Intact
The AI data-center build-out by hyperscale and neo-cloud providers is well underway based on
companies' planned capital investments. We count 2.7 gigawatts of planned US AI data-center
construction committed by cloud and neocloud providers that's slated to be open and operational
in 2025-26. For networking and hardware vendors, precise sales visibility is limited due to the
uncertain timing on completing the projects.
Multiple 100,000-plus GPU clusters are planned in 2025, including xAI’s 200,000-GPU cluster.
Looking out to 2026, neo-cloud providers, such as Crusoe, and others are bringing 200-megawatt
data-center facilities online, which would be enough to house 100,000 Blackwell GPU clusters.
Ultimately, this bodes well for equipment vendors in terms of volume and higher-priced gear.

Though Super Micro and Dell delivered good sales execution during the Hopper product cycle, AI
server vendors should get a meaningful boost when the Blackwell cycle ramps up in 2H. We expect
$1-$3 billion AI server deals to be common in 2025-26 due to the growing number of 100,000-GPU
clusters, along with more 32,000- and 64,000-GPU deals, complementing a 2-3-fold price increase
per server rack to $3-$4 million each. (03/19/25)
US AI Server Sales Trend, Estimates
18. Deepseek Fuels AI Adoption, Not Burst Bubble
There's little evidence that Deepseek and other eﬃcient foundational models have led to curtailed
spending on servers and networking gear in the near term. The rising number of 100,000-plus GPU
buildouts, paired with increased cloud-spending plans for 2025-26, supports this. However, we
believe the eﬃciency of these models will drive down the cost of their output -- a trend that isn't
unique to Deepseek and is already happening in the industry.
Two views on the impact on inference infrastructure exist: fewer servers will be needed to do more,
or the falling cost to run AI models will spark greater adoption and workloads, therefore requiring
more gear. Vertically integrated AI compute vendor Cerebras is an example of the latter, since it's
building 20x token-production capacity in 2025 to support anticipated demand. (03/19/25)

Cerebras AI Inference Capacity
19. Tariﬀs Challenges Appear Manageable
The impact of tariﬀs might be more pronounced for networkers than for AI server vendors, but
supply-chain ﬂexibility may help the group navigate around the levies. Super Micro, Dell and HPE's
AI servers could be insulated from tariﬀs, since they're largely produced domestically. Though
Mexico has emerged as a key manufacturing hub for networking vendors such as Arista and Cisco,
contract manufacturers may have enough ﬂexibility to maneuver and mitigate much of the tariﬀ
impact.
Fierce pricing competition will likely remain an overhang on server margin. Given the growing
volume of large neo-cloud and sovereign deals, we expect sever vendors to price aggressively,
which could keep AI server margin in the mid- to upper-single digits over the near-to-intermediate
term. (03/19/25)
