The company’s active capital investments and growing PPE base underscore its continued commitment to capacity expansion and innovation, supported by consistent R&D spending as a percentage of revenue. Although leverage increased somewhat due to higher long-term debt, the company’s conservative debt-to-equity ratio and robust earnings power suggest manageable financial risk. Inventory turnover improvement indicates enhanced operational efficiency, but a decline in receivables turnover warrants attention to credit terms and collection practices.

      "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — CSX railroad's profit fell 27% in the first quarter as two major construction projects forced them to reroute some trains and constrained its response to flooding and other weather challenges, curtailing shipments.\n",
      "The Jacksonville, Florida-based railroad said it earned $646 million net income, or 34 cents per share, during the quarter. That's down from $880 million, or 45 cents per share, a year ago, and the results fell short of Wall Street expectations.\n",
      "The analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted CSX would earn 37 cents a share.\n",
      "CEO Joe Hinrichs said the quarter was disappointing but the railroad is committed to improving its performance. And even with the delayed and missed shipments Hinrichs said shippers still gave the railroad good marks on a customer service survey because CSX worked to keep them updated on problems.\n",
      "CSX is in the middle of expanding a key tunnel in Baltimore, so it will be able to carry double-stacked shipping containers, and the railroad is completing repairs related to Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Both those projects are scheduled to wrap up in the fourth quarter of this year, so the railroad will be constrained until then.\n",
      "Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said CSX lost the flexibility it normally uses to respond to weather disruptions because of the construction projects.\n",
      "Hinrichs said that right now two of CSX's main north-south routes are closed on the East Coast so it had to shift traffic over to the central and western parts of its network, which are now crowded. Then when customers weren't getting their empty rail cars returned on time because of the delays they added additional cars and added to the congestion.\n",
      "“The resiliency of our network has been diminished because we lost some routes,” Hinrichs said in an interview with The Associated Press. Later he added “The shocks are what we are having trouble responding to.”\n",
      "Hinrichs said he still expects volume to increase overall this year, but it's hard to predict how much because of all the uncertainty about trade policy. But right now demand is still holding steady across most sectors while companies wait to see which tariffs are going to stick.\n",
      "President Donald Trump's trade war could lead to a drop in shipments of imported goods, but so far the railroad said demand remains fairly steady. And in the long run, CSX could benefit from the expected increase in U.S. manufacturing because the railroad will haul raw materials and finished products for those factories.\n",
      "But during this first quarter, deliveries of shipping containers actually grew 2% as some companies tried to get more of their shipments ahead of Trump's tariffs.\n",
      "CSX said the total volume of shipments it delivered slipped 1%, and revenue dropped 7% to $3.42 billion as coal and fuel surcharge revenue fell. That also came in lower than the $3.45 billion that analysts expected.\n",
      "CSX and the other eastern railroad, Norfolk Southern, could also benefit long term if more of the country's exports shift from China toward Europe and India because those destinations would be served through East Coast ports. Currently, Trump has maintained high tariffs on China, which responded in kind, but he gave the rest of the world a 90-day reprieve to allow time to negotiate new trade deals.\n",

      "The next big Doom game, Doom: The Dark Ages , arrives next month. And to help celebrate, Xbox has announced two new Doom-themed controllers, one of which features spikes, blood, and demonic glyphs.\n",
      "Officially revealed in January , Doom: The Dark Ages is a massive and awesome-looking prequel to the recent Doom games from id Software and Bethesda. The upcoming FPS is set to launch on May 15 for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Dark Ages tells the tale of the Doom Slayer aka Doom Guy’s war against Hell and all the nasty monsters that call the realm home. It will feature giant mechs and dragons, and might be the coolest game I’ve seen in years. So I’m not surprised the new Xbox controller inspired by the game is also pretty dang cool.\n",
      "On April 16, Xbox announced a new, limited-edition $80 Doom controller that is available now until it sells out . The controller is designed to look like the Doom Slayer’s armor, complete with some blood splatter and the Slayer’s symbol carved into the right handle.\n",
      "One bit I really like about the new controller is that it features 3D spikes near the Xbox guide button. Now of course, these aren’t very big or super sharp, but it’s a nice touch that makes this feel like more than just a repaint of a standard Xbox gamepad.\n",
      "Beyond the new controller, Microsoft also unveiled a different Doom -themed Xbox Elite Controller that is darker and more sinister looking. That one isn’t out yet, but you can pre-order it starting today. It does cost $200, so keep that in mind . There’s also a new Xbox Series X console wrap that turns your console into a shrine dedicated to the Doom Slayer.  This is out now for $55, but is only available on the Microsoft Store.\n",
      "I’m very tempted to pick up that standard Xbox controller with the blood and spikes. It feels like the perfect way to play Doom: The Dark Ages when it arrives on May 15. Well, I mean the actual perfect way to play is on a PC with a keyboard and mouse, but this might be the second best way to kill demons next month.\n",

Netflix stands apart, however, as its shares have jumped 9.6% this year while the broader market has tumbled by roughly the same percentage.\n",
      "Several analysts view Netflix as a largely recession-proof stock given its strong competitive moat and its subscription-based service, which is not directly affected by U.S. tariffs or levies from other countries.\n",
      "Major firms think Netflix’s long-term outlook of reaching a $1 trillion valuation by 2030 is realistic.

      "Choice laws have now passed in every major Republican state. Congress and President Trump are now aiming at blue states that have resisted vouchers for decades.\n",
      "By Dana Goldstein and Sarah Mervosh\n",
      "With a big win for school vouchers in Texas in the early hours of Thursday morning, the private-school choice movement conquered the last major Republican-led state.\n",
      "Next up, the rest of the country.\n",
      "Voucher advocates will now turn their attention to Washington, D.C., where Republican allies are advancing a bill that could force the concept even on Democratic states that have resisted for decades. In President Trump and Republican leaders in Congress, voucher proponents have friends in the highest of places. They also have a plan for a federal private-school choice program that could pass this year with simple majorities in the House and the Senate.\n",
      "“It’s a monumental and cascading moment for the school choice movement,” said Tommy Schultz, chief executive of the American Federation for Children, a private-school choice advocacy group.\n",
      "In recent years, the nation’s Republican-dominated and Democratic-dominated states have gone their separate ways on fundamental issues such as abortion rights, health insurance, climate change and energy policy. On education, red states, in a remarkable procession, have adopted measures to use taxpayer dollars to finance private school tuition and home-schooling.\n",
      "In many cases, Washington has let the states drift apart. Vouchers might be different.\n",
      "A national bill would bring private-school choice to states where Democrats and teachers’ unions have always been successful in quashing the concept, contending that vouchers could drain resources from public education, diminish learning standards and leave the most disadvantaged children warehoused in poorly funded public schools.\n",
      "The federal legislation is structured as a $10 billion tax credit for donations to nonprofit groups that offer private-education scholarships, and as such, it could be included as part of a giant budget reconciliation bill expected to be assembled this summer. If so, it would need only 51 votes in a Senate where Republicans hold 53 seats.\n",
      "The scholarships would be made available to students as a voucher. A vast majority of families could be eligible, based on their household incomes not exceeding 300 percent of their area’s median income — over $300,000 per year in some regions.\n",
      "The bill could end up providing $5,000 vouchers to as many as 2 million children annually. The money could be used not only on private-school tuition, but also for home-schooling costs or for-profit virtual learning.\n",
      "“If we’re serious about raising the bar and expanding opportunity, school choice has to be part of the equation,” said Representative Burgess Owens, Republican of Utah and a cosponsor of the legislation, citing low test scores.\n",
      "The Senate’s chief sponsor, Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, said on Thursday that he was optimistic, but that passage “is not a sure thing.”\n",
      "The vociferous objections of Democrats, teachers’ unions and many public-school parents have not changed.\n",
      "Critics have raised concerns about the limited number of seats in private education to serve millions of new children, and pointed to the fact that some existing private schools have raised their tuitions in response to the influx of taxpayer dollars — making it difficult for low-income families to take advantage of vouchers, since the amount received is often less than the full cost of attending a private school.\n",
      "They have also pointed out that new schools founded to take advantage of private-school choice policies have sometimes struggled to find their footing and shut down quickly, sending students back into public education.\n",
      "Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, called the Republican proposal in Congress “an attempt to redistribute dollars to the wealthy through another tax cut, pretending it’s for schools.”\n",
      "And she contrasted Mr. Trump’s support for tax incentives to fund private-school vouchers with his many attempts to cut off federal funding to schools and universities that do not hew to his priorities around race and gender, and to withdraw Harvard’s tax-exempt status.\n",
      "“The road they’re taking, trying to make the tax code ideological as opposed to financial, is a very dangerous road,” she said.\n",
      "Despite fierce resistance from Democrats, in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic, vouchers have boomed, propelled by conservative donors, right-wing activists and ordinary parents frustrated by school closures, mask mandates and what they could see of the curriculum when their children were learning online.\n",
      "Public dollars are now financing private education for over 1 million students nationwide, more than double the number in 2019.\n",
      "In 2022, Arizona pioneered a new approach: universal vouchers available to all students, in the form of education savings accounts filled with public dollars that could be spent on almost any private school or home-school expense. It expanded an existing program, which had been reserved for students with disabilities and other specific challenges.\n",
      "The biggest rush came in the first year, largely driven by families already in private school or home-schooling, a built-in clientele that was happy to quickly sign up for a subsidy from the state.\n",
      "About 60,000 Arizona students were enrolled after the first school year, up from 12,000 before the expansion. Half had never been enrolled in public school.\n",
      "The program has continued to grow, with enrollment now at 83,000.\n",
      "As time has gone on, enrollees have been more likely to come directly from public schools. For new sign-ups last summer and fall, about 55 percent of students came from public school, up from 20 percent a few years ago.\n",
      "Wealthier areas still have some of the highest rates of uptake for the program, according to an analysis of 2024 data by the Brookings Institution, a liberal-leaning think tank. Those include areas like Scottsdale and Paradise Valley, two affluent suburbs of Phoenix.\n",
      "Fewer private schools are in poor neighborhoods, and families cannot always afford tuition, which is often higher than the $7,000 to $8,000 typically provided by the state.\n",
      "In part because of the limited uptake in low-income neighborhoods, there has not been the feared mass exodus from the most vulnerable public school districts, said Dave Wells, research director for the Grand Canyon Institute, a nonpartisan research group that has studied the program.\n",
      "He said the biggest losses have often come from charter schools, which already serve families who have learned to exercise educational choice, and from more affluent public school districts.\n",
      "Arizona’s total public school enrollment, including charter schools, has hovered around 1.1 million, with slight declines in recent years that can also be attributed to falling birthrates and other demographic trends.\n",
      "Other states have limited their programs, in part to avoid the steep costs faced in Arizona, where demand has outpaced initial projections and costs are expected to reach $1 billion next year.\n",
      "Nonetheless, with Texas’ imminent adoption, the education savings account approach has taken off in 18 states . No longer aimed at only small numbers of low-income children, students in low-performing schools and students with disabilities, vouchers are now being pushed for everyone.\n",
      "“What we are doing is redefining public education to mean an educated public, regardless of where they are educated,” said Robert Enlow, president of EdChoice, the voucher advocacy and research group founded by the movement’s godfather, the free-market economist Milton Friedman.\n",
      "The moment also represents a major shift for the Republican Party.\n",
      "Texas, after all, is the home state of George W. Bush, the former president and governor who embodied a now-antiquated style of G.O.P. education politics — termed “compassionate conservatism,” in Mr. Bush’s memorable phrasing.\n",
      "He saw only a limited role for vouchers, in providing an escape hatch for children attending the lowest-performing public schools. His bigger focus was on improving basic education in public schools. He promoted phonics in early grades, a strategy backed by research, and pushed hard on standardized testing, holding educators accountable for raising student scores.\n",
      "Many on the left hated the emphasis on testing. But looking back, some acknowledge they shared key values with that earlier generation of Republicans.\n",
      "“Bush really had in mind reforming public schools and improving public education,” said Clay Robison, a spokesman for the Texas State Teachers Association, a union affiliate, and a longtime observer of Austin politics. “That has changed as the Republican Party has changed.”\n",
      "Indeed, the education savings account bill that passed the Texas House on Thursday displayed drastically different ideas.\n",
      "While at first it will prioritize low-income and disabled children, it creates a pathway toward universal eligibility for vouchers — even for students already attending private school, whose parents have no problem paying the tuition out of pocket.\n",
      "In campaigning for the bill, supporters did not dwell on old arguments that promoted choice’s potential to improve public education through competition, or on the belief that academic achievement would improve in private schools.\n",
      "Instead, Gov. Greg Abbott and allies emphasized parental rights and personalized learning. They also leaned on the culture war issues that have dominated the Trump era, arguing that vouchers would allow families to escape liberal teachings on gender, sexuality and race.\n",
      "The national bill is structured to make an even greater percentage of families immediately eligible, including affluent ones.\n",
      "For voucher advocates, the moment is filled with possibility. But they also acknowledge that the private-education system will need to grow quickly if it is to serve millions more children across the country.\n",
      "They are hopeful about new models like microschools , which are led by a single teacher and often meet in a home, and about the burst in venture capital investment in virtual schooling.\n",
      "“Now the real hard work starts, building new learning opportunities,” said Mr. Enlow of EdChoice. He sketched out a future in which students receive credit for being at school if they visit a museum, or combine online learning with a few days per week in a classroom.\n",
      "“The growth here,” he added, “is in the marketplace of options outside of buildings.”\n",

      "Lisa Murkowski, a longtime senator from Alaska and an independent voice in an increasingly tribal party, has been the rare Republican on Capitol Hill willing to criticize President Trump’s actions.\n",
      "By Annie Karni\n",
      "Senator Lisa Murkowski, the moderate Alaska Republican who has routinely broken with her party to criticize President Trump, has made a startling admission about the reality of serving in public office at a time when an unbound leader in the Oval Office is bent on retribution against his political foes.\n",
      "“We are all afraid,” Ms. Murkowski said, speaking at a conference in Anchorage on Monday. After pausing for about five seconds, she acknowledged: “It’s quite a statement. But we are in a time and a place where I certainly have not been here before. I’ll tell you, I’m oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real. And that’s not right.”\n",
      "Ms. Murkowski’s comments were first reported by The Anchorage Daily News .\n",
      "Ms. Murkowski, an independent voice in an increasingly tribal party, has been the rare Republican on Capitol Hill willing to criticize the Trump administration. After Mr. Trump in February berated President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in the Oval Office, she warned that the United States was “walking away from our allies.”\n",
      "She has routinely criticized the Department of Government Efficiency for creating a “tremendous amount of unnecessary anxiety” and for firing federal workers in her state. And Ms. Murkowski was one of only three Republicans who voted not to confirm Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n",
      "Ms. Murkowski has become more outspoken in Mr. Trump’s second term, but she has long been part of a small minority in her party willing to stand up to its leader at a time when most G.O.P. lawmakers have chosen to fall in line. She was one of seven Republicans who voted in 2021 to convict Mr. Trump in his second impeachment trial, and the only one up for re-election at the time. She was also one of three Republicans who voted to support Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the Supreme Court.\n",
      "Ms. Murkowski has been upfront about her discomfort in a party led by Mr. Trump, whom she said she refused to vote for last year; Ms. Murkowski endorsed former Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina for president. At the time, Ms. Murkowski even considered leaving the party altogether, although she has not done so.\n",

      "James Bennet, the former New York Times Opinion editor, took responsibility for an error in an editorial at the center of the case.\n",
      "By Katie Robertson\n",
      "James Bennet, the former New York Times Opinion editor, told a jury on Thursday that he was the person responsible for rewriting crucial parts of an editorial that Sarah Palin said defamed her.\n",
      "Ms. Palin, the former governor of Alaska and onetime Republican vice-presidential nominee, sued The Times in 2017 over the editorial, which erroneously linked her political action committee to a mass shooting. The editorial was fixed and a correction was issued the day after publication.\n",
      "“I blew it, you know,” Mr. Bennet said on the stand, choking up with emotion. “I made a mistake.”\n",
      "The case is being tried for a second time in a federal court in Manhattan after an appeals court ruled last year that the judge had made several errors that had tainted the previous trial in 2022. In that trial, both the judge and a jury ruled against Ms. Palin.\n",
      "While the facts in the case remain the same, the new trial comes amid a vastly different media landscape . President Trump has returned to office and ramped up his attacks against the press , trust in the news media has continued to decline, and several high-profile defamation cases have resulted in significant payouts.\n",
      "At issue is the original version of an editorial that described an atmosphere of heated political rhetoric in the wake of a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Virginia. The editorial wrongly linked a map distributed by Ms. Palin’s political action committee, which displayed cross hairs over Democratic congressional electoral districts, to a deadly 2011 shooting that also gravely injured Gabrielle Giffords, then a Democratic member of Congress.\n",
      "There is no evidence the gunman ever saw the map. The Times corrected the editorial soon after it was published and issued an apology on social media.\n",
      "Lawyers for Ms. Palin are seeking to paint Mr. Bennet, who left The Times in 2020, as having intentionally inserted a passage into the editorial to lay blame directly on Ms. Palin. The Times and Mr. Bennet have countered that it was an honest mistake made on deadline that was quickly fixed and acknowledged.\n",
      "On Wednesday, lawyers questioned Mr. Bennet about his brother, Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado. He said he might have been aware that there were threats at his brother’s office in the days after the 2011 shooting of Ms. Giffords. But Mr. Bennet, who at that time was the editor of The Atlantic, said that he did not know if The Atlantic had written about the threats and that he had recused himself from any coverage involving his brother.\n",
      "Mr. Bennet took the stand again on Thursday, with Ms. Palin sitting nearby. He acknowledged having rewritten parts of the editorial and inserting the words “the link to political incitement was clear” in reference to the map from Ms. Palin’s political action committee and the shooting. But he disagreed with the suggestion that he had meant to imply a direct causal link.\n",
      "“I did not think we were saying the map caused him to act,” Mr. Bennet told the jury, explaining that he meant the rhetoric “could have a role.”\n",
      "He also said he had not fact-checked what he had written because he did not think he had added any new facts into the editorial and thought it would be checked over by editors.\n",
      "Mr. Bennet became emotional over the issue of an apology to Ms. Palin. Her lawyer, Shane Vogt, had said in his opening statement that The Times had never apologized to Ms. Palin and did not name her in the correction on the editorial.\n",
      "“I did and I do apologize to Governor Palin,” Mr. Bennet said. “It was a mistake.”\n",
      "Mr. Bennet also said the reference to Ms. Palin’s political action committee in the editorial was not meant to imply anything about Ms. Palin herself.\n",
      "“There wasn’t any part of me that thought that Sarah Palin herself had drawn the cross hairs on the map or something like that,” he said.\n",
      "The trial will continue next week, when Ms. Palin is expected to testify.\n",

      "A legal challenge filed Thursday aims to encourage Central American countries to push back against the Trump administration’s immigration policies.\n",
      "By Emiliano Rodríguez Mega and James Wagner\n",
      "Reporting from Mexico City\n",
      "A group of lawyers on Thursday filed a suit against Costa Rica, claiming that it has violated the rights of dozens of minors deported from the United States by detaining them for nearly two months and by holding them in conditions “that could cause irreparable harm.”\n",
      "This is the second high-profile legal challenge against a Central American nation that has agreed to take in hundreds of deportees expelled by U.S. authorities — the result of the Trump administration’s effort to get other countries to help it carry out mass deportations.\n",
      "The latest lawsuit was filed by a group of migrant rights lawyers before the U.N. committee that monitors the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child .\n",
      "Ian Kysel, a professor at Cornell Law School and a founding member of the Global Strategic Litigation Council, one of the organizations filing the lawsuit, said that because Costa Rica has agreed to additional measures under the U.N. treaty, complaints against it can be brought to the panel of experts.\n",
      "That panel can issue a directive, he said, but “ultimately, it’s going to be up to Costa Rica to follow it, and for other states who have signed on to this, to kind of shame them if they don’t.”\n",
      "In late February, 200 migrants from nations outside the Western Hemisphere, such as China, Iran, Vietnam and Uzbekistan, arrived in Costa Rica on two deportation flights from the United States. The group, which included 81 children, was then bused to a remote facility several hours from the capital, near the border with Panama, to wait there until migrants either asked to be sent back to their home countries or were granted asylum by some other nation.\n",
      "Omer Badilla, the head of Costa Rica’s migration authority, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit or the conditions the deportees lived in. Government officials have disputed reports made by human rights groups — and by Costa Rica’s ombudsman — that the deportees have been mistreated.\n",
      "President Rodrigo Chaves of Costa Rica has said his country would only act as “a bridge,” a temporary transit point for foreigners deported from the United States.\n",
      "“We are helping the economically powerful brother to the north, who if they impose a tax in our free trade zone, it’ll screw us,” he said in February . “And besides, love is repaid with love.”\n",
      "It is unclear how many people remain in the detention facility, a former pencil factory now called the Temporary Attention Center for Migrants, where they were supposed to stay for up to 30 days.\n",
      "Since the U.N. panel may take many months to issue a ruling on Costa Rica, the lawyers have asked for an interim emergency order.\n",
      "The suit described the stories of four representative children, between the ages 2 and 10, whose families said they had fled persecution in countries such as Azerbaijan or Iran, and claimed they have lacked access to schooling, pediatricians or legal counsel while in Costa Rica.\n",
      "On a recent sweltering day at the center, Saber, a 31-year-old Afghan man, worried about what he, his wife and their toddler would do if returned to their homeland. “We can’t go back to Afghanistan, we are not safe there,” he said in an interview, asking, like other migrants at the facility, that only his first name be used out of fear he could be repatriated.\n",
      "The coalition of international lawyers who filed the suit estimates that nearly 100 people are still detained, including about 50 children. The rest have been repatriated, according to a letter Costa Rica’s government signed in March.\n",
      "“They’ve made these people leave Costa Rica through what they call ‘voluntary returns,’” said Silvia Serna Román, the lead litigator in the case. “But if you put them in a situation where they are forced to make a decision, then you strip away the voluntary nature of these returns.”\n",
      "Until recently, Costa Rican authorities insisted that no migrant had expressed fear of returning to their home country. In an interview in March, however, Mr. Badilla, the head of Costa Rica’s migration authority, acknowledged that some migrants were fearful.\n",
      "“If a person fears for his or her life in his or her country of origin, Costa Rica will not send that person back,” Mr. Badilla said. This month, the government said 16 Chinese nationals had requested asylum in Costa Rica.\n",
      "Many of the lawyers who sued Costa Rica did the same with Panama in March.\n",
      "That case was filed before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and claimed that the detention of the migrants violated domestic and international laws. A week later, Panama released over 100 migrants who had been deported there from the United States the previous month and were being held in a remote jungle camp .\n",
      "Mr. Kysel, the Cornell law school professor, said the goal was to scrutinize countries that have aided the Trump administration’s immigration policies, particularly its efforts to take away the right to seek asylum, and to urge Latin American governments to push back.\n",

      "The Trump administration is on course for a potential constitutional clash with the judiciary branch, which has issued several rulings countering executive orders.\n",
      "By Alan Feuer and Abbie VanSickle\n",
      "A number of major cases challenging President Trump’s initial moves on immigration are making their way through the legal system. Mr. Trump has moved aggressively to detain and deport migrants, but a series of his moves have been challenged in court. In a number of those cases, federal judges have responded by ordering the Trump administration to give due process to people being deported. The administration has dragged its feet to avoid some of those rulings, setting up a potential constitutional clash between the executive and judiciary branches.\n",
      "Here’s a look at where some of the biggest cases stand, and what comes next.\n",
      "On his first day back in office, Mr. Trump issued an executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants and foreign residents. Birthright citizenship, the guarantee that a person born in the United States is automatically a citizen, has long been considered a central tenet of the United States.\n",
      "The 14th Amendment, which was ratified after the Civil War, declares that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” The Supreme Court affirmed the guarantee of automatic citizenship for nearly all children born in the United States in 1898 in the case of Wong Kim Ark , where the justices found that under the 14th Amendment, Mr. Wong, who was born in 1873 to Chinese parents living in San Francisco, was a U.S. citizen.\n",
      "The order prompted a flurry of lawsuits, including challenges by Democratic attorneys general and civil rights groups. Federal courts in Massachusetts, Maryland and Washington State issued temporary directives that paused the order for the entire country while court challenges continued. One federal judge called the order “blatantly unconstitutional.”\n",
      "The Trump administration pushed back against the nationwide pause on the policy, filing an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court. The administration asked the court to lift the pause and allow the policy to go into effect in states that had not challenged it.\n",
      "In a rare move, the justices announced they would hear oral arguments in the matter on May 15. They deferred any decision on the nationwide pause until after the arguments, leaving it in place for now.\n",
      "There are currently at least five lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s use of a powerful wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan immigrants accused of being members of Tren de Aragua, a violent street gang.\n",
      "Most of the cases were filed after the Supreme Court ruled that the immigrants must be allowed to challenge their deportations under the act before they are removed from the country. The court said those cases should be filed where the migrants are being detained.\n",
      "The lawsuit that led to the Supreme Court’s decision was brought in March in Washington, D.C., after immigration lawyers learned that the White House was preparing to fly nearly 140 Venezuelans to a notorious prison in El Salvador without any due process.\n",
      "A federal judge in Washington, James E. Boasberg, told the administration to stop the flights from departing on March 15, but they did anyway, raising questions about whether administration officials had willfully disobeyed his order.\n",
      "The cases outside Washington — in Colorado, Texas and New York — are likely to move forward in the weeks to come in a fairly normal manner as lawyers for the immigrants and lawyers for the Justice Department argue over two main issues: Can the Alien Enemies Act be used in peacetime, and to deport people who are not obviously members of a hostile foreign nation? And can the administration sustain its claims that the Venezuelan men it wants to deport are actually members of Tren de Aragua?\n",
      "Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union are trying to revive the case in Washington in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling in an effort to get due process for the Venezuelan men who are no longer on U.S. soil.\n",
      "Additionally, Judge Boasberg has threatened to open an investigation into who in the administration was responsible for the “willful disregard” shown for his initial order about the deportation flights, unless Trump officials do something they have resisted for a month: figure out how to allow the Venezuelans in custody in El Salvador to retroactively challenge their deportations.\n",
      "A federal appeals court in Virginia reaffirmed on Thursday that the Trump administration had to play a more active role in seeking the release of a Maryland man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, from the same Salvadoran prison where the Venezuelan men were sent. The Justice Department has already acknowledged that Mr. Abrego Garcia was flown to the prison in error on March 15 despite a court order expressly forbidding that he be sent there.\n",
      "The ruling by the appeals court was the third judicial order — including one from the Supreme Court — that directed the White House to “facilitate” the release of Mr. Abrego Garcia from Salvadoran custody and figure out a way to give him the due process that he would have been afforded had he not been wrongfully deported.\n",
      "But Trump officials have spent the better part of the three weeks trying various methods to avoid complying with those orders.\n",
      "In the near term, Judge Paula Xinis, who is overseeing the case in Federal District Court in Maryland, will conduct an inquiry — not unlike Judge Boasberg’s — into who, if anyone, inside the Trump administration is responsible for the way the White House has delayed complying with the various rulings in the case.\n",
      "Ultimately, the courts may also have to decide what it actually means to “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, has said he will not set the Maryland man free.\n",
      "The Justice Department has taken a narrow view of the matter, saying it could comply with court orders simply by helping Mr. Abrego Garcia enter the United States if he was released from the Salvadoran prison and made his way to a U.S. port of entry.\n",
      "But the appeals court in Virginia disagreed, saying that “‘facilitate’ is an active verb” and does not “allow the government to do essentially nothing.”\n",

      "Elaine Wynn, who built a glamorous casino-and-resort empire with her former husband, Steve Wynn, transforming Las Vegas into a global destination, and who went on to become a powerful education advocate, arts patron and Democratic fund-raiser, died on Monday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 82.\n",
      "The cause was heart failure, her daughter Gillian Wynn said.\n",
      "By the time the Wynns arrived in Las Vegas in 1967, it had lost its Rat Pack sheen and was primed for a reset. The couple were newlyweds with a new baby, but they already knew a thing or two about the gambling business.\n",
      "A few years earlier, Mr. Wynn had been on his way to Yale Law School when his father, who owned a string of bingo parlors in Maryland — and had a serious gambling habit — died suddenly, leaving his eldest son with the business and a load of debt. The couple worked the bingo parlors together, paid off the debt and then moved to the desert, where Mr. Wynn had been offered a tiny stake in a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.\n",
      "Within a decade — and with a few real estate deals under his belt, including buying a vacant lot from Howard Hughes, the agoraphobic billionaire — Mr. Wynn had taken over the Golden Nugget, a down-at-the-heels casino, and begun gussying it up. Soon, he was crafting an empire, helped early on by Michael Milken, the disgraced junk-bond king.\n",
      "The Wynns then began to remake the Strip with their capstone property, the Mirage. They envisioned it as a luxurious resort — something much more than a casino. When it opened in 1989, with more than 3,000 rooms on 65 acres, it was among the largest and most expensive resorts in the world, built for $630 million (close to $1.7 billion in today’s money).\n",
      "The theme was tropical. The lobby had an aquarium wall. Out front, a volcano in a lagoon erupted every night. There were also exotic animals — in a dolphin habitat and research center, as well as a four-acre jungle habitat for big cats (and, at one point, an elephant), otherwise known as Siegfried and Roy’s Secret Garden, after the resort’s flamboyant headliners.\n",
      "Ms. Wynn was the aesthetic partner in the venture, overseeing the architecture, the interiors and the employee uniforms. She was the one who argued to set the resort back from the sidewalk, to give it a gracious entrance and show off its distinctive Y-shaped design, which would later be much mimicked by other casino owners.\n",
      "“Don’t Reno-ize the strip,” she told Mr. Wynn.\n",
      "And when her husband wanted to put a dolphin habitat behind their house, it was Ms. Wynn who persuaded him to move that idea to the Mirage.\n",
      "At a time when the wives of powerful men were decorative adjuncts, Ms. Wynn was “an equal partner in the success of Wynn Resorts,” said Mary Boies, a lawyer at Boies Schiller Flexner and a longtime friend (with her lawyer husband, David Boies). “Steve was the money, and Elaine did the design and the people.”\n",
      "Ms. Boies added: “She set the template for all that followed in Las Vegas. Neither would have worked without the other.”\n",
      "The Wynns went on to build a portfolio of ever more elaborate resorts, including the Bellagio, with its collection of blue-chip art; the Wynn Macau, in China; and Encore Las Vegas. But their relationship was challenging — in ways that would not become public until much later.\n",
      "Mr. Wynn was charismatic, mercurial and even visionary, despite a degenerative eye disease. Ms. Wynn was the steadying force. The couple divorced in 1986, during the building of the Mirage, but continued to live and work together.\n",
      "“A lot of marriages reach that critical point when the man wants the wife to stay the same as when he first met her, to be the nurturer, supporter, cheerleader,” Ms. Wynn told GQ magazine in 1990. “There has to be a shift if that relationship is to survive.”\n",
      "They remarried a year later.\n",
      "In 1993, the Wynns’ daughter Kevyn, then 26, was kidnapped from her home in Las Vegas. Mr. Wynn paid a $1.4 million ransom for her release, and she was found bound in her car in a parking garage but otherwise unharmed.\n",
      "He did not alert the police or his wife when the kidnapper phoned him, fearful for his daughter’s safety. He waited until she was safe and in his arms, and then phoned Ms. Wynn.\n",
      "“I think the height of my admiration and respect and love for Steve centers on that episode,” Ms. Wynn told The New York Times Magazine in 2012. “I never, ever questioned that he did the right thing. He spared me.” (The kidnapper was later arrested in Newport Beach, Calif., buying a Ferrari with $100 bills.)\n",
      "When Mr. Wynn, in a notorious incident in 2006, stuck his elbow through the canvas of “Le Rêve,” Picasso’s 1932 painting of his mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter, it was Ms. Wynn who calmed him. He was in his office showing off the painting to Barbara Walters, the Boieses, the author Nick Pileggi and his wife, Nora Ephron, and others, when it happened. Mr. Wynn had bought the painting with Steven Cohen, the hedge-fund manager, for $139 million, the highest price ever paid for an artwork at the time.\n",
      "“I can’t believe I did that, but thank God it was me!” Mr. Pileggi recalled him saying before calling Ms. Wynn. Mr. Pileggi was close enough to hear her soothing tones.\n",
      "“I thought,” he said in an interview, “‘Wow, this is some relationship.’ Elaine did not enter the frenzy. That’s the kind of person she was. Nora adored her.”\n",
      "“Did I create an environment that allowed him to thrive?” Ms. Wynn mused in 2012. “Did I create an anchoring to the personality that made us have good equilibrium? That’s what I’d say I hope my contribution is.”\n",
      "By 2010, the Wynns had divorced again, this time permanently, splitting their shares in the company, which amounted to a controlling stake of 36 percent, then valued $1.4 billion. Ms. Wynn remained on the board but stepped down as director of Wynn Resorts, and out of the shadow of her husband.\n",
      "She turned her focus to supporting the arts and education, as national chairwoman and a trustee of Communities in Schools, an organization that works to lower dropout rates. She also served on the Nevada State Board of Education.\n",
      "Ms. Wynn was an early contributor to President Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, and he appointed her to the Kennedy Center’s board, where she served until the first Trump administration. The Obamas remained friends, as the former president and Ms. Wynn shared a passion — in Ms. Wynn’s case, a fierce passion — for college basketball. (She was a Duke fan.)\n",
      "In 2016, she provided a $50 million donation to kick-start the Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s $650 million expansion, designed by the architect Peter Zumthor. She also helped fund the installation of the land artist Michael Heizer’s “Levitated Mass” on the museum’s campus, as well as his monumental work in the Nevada desert, “City,” as it neared completion after many decades.\n",
      "She began to buy art, besting her former husband with her 2013 purchase of the Francis Bacon triptych “Three Studies of Lucian Freud,” which she won at auction with a bid of $142.4 million, after commission, beating Mr. Wynn’s record of paying the highest price for an artwork.\n",
      "“First I was worried I’d want to buy it,” she told Forbes magazine in 2016 , recalling when she first saw the triptych. “Then I was worried I might not get it.”\n",
      "Elaine Farrell Pascal was born on April 28, 1942, in New York City, one of three children of Lee (Stollman) Pascal and Jules Pascal. She grew up in Miami Beach, where her father ran package tours. A Lauren Bacall beauty by 16, she was named Miss Miami Beach in 1960.\n",
      "When she was a freshman at the University of California, Los Angeles, she and Steve were set up on a blind date by their parents — the date was dinner, with their parents, at the Miami Jai-Alai Fronton, now the Casino Miami. The Pascals and the Wynns had abutting poolside cabanas at the Fontainebleau Hotel, and the husbands were gin rummy buddies.\n",
      "It was an instant match, by all accounts.\n",
      "They married in 1963 and settled in Maryland to oversee Mr. Wynn’s bingo parlors. Ms. Wynn transferred to the George Washington University, graduating with a bachelor’s degree in 1964.\n",
      "In addition to her daughters, Ms. Wynn is survived by seven grandchildren and a brother, Joel Pascal.\n",
      "Ms. Wynn recalled the energy of Las Vegas when she first arrived, the zest of a place on the make, and the loose community of headliners and showgirls there, as she told Cathy Horyn of The Times in 2006. And yet, she added: “I felt threatened by Las Vegas. It seemed very fast for a middle-class Jewish girl.”\n",
      "When the Wynns divorced for the second time in 2010 and split their shares in the company, Ms. Wynn agreed to vote her shares with her husband, so he could maintain control of the board. But after a few years she was forced off the board and had to sue to regain her shares.\n",
      "Then, in 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported repeated allegations of sexual harassment by Mr. Wynn from multiple employees, including a manicurist who received a $7.5 million settlement after claiming he had forced her to have sex with him. Mr. Wynn, who denied the allegations, resigned as chief executive, leaving his wife as the company’s largest shareholder.\n",
      "“I could just quietly sell my shares and go off into the sunset and pursue philanthropy,” Ms. Wynn told James B. Stewart of The Times that year. “But my mantra is, it’s not where you start in life, it’s where you end up. And I’m not about to go off and leave this company that I helped build, as tarnished as it has become.”\n",
      "At her death, Forbes magazine estimated her net worth at $2 billion, and Wynn Resorts had market cap of about $7.9 billion.\n",
      "For years, Ms. Wynn and Michael Govan, the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, had been discussing building an art museum in Las Vegas. It would be the city’s first. Last year, she told him, “It’s time.”\n",
      "The museum, in partnership with LACMA, will be built in the city’s new arts district, Symphony Park, and designed by Francis Kéré , a Pritzker-Prize winning architect from Burkina Faso.\n",

      "Menendez Brothers Case\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Supported by\n",
      "The proceedings were pushed back for three weeks over the issue of whether a key report on Erik and Lyle Menendez was admissible.\n",
      "By Tim Arango and Matt Stevens\n",
      "Tim Arango reported from inside Los Angeles Superior Court. Matt Stevens reported from Los Angeles.\n",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez will have to wait a little longer to see if they may finally walk free.\n",
      "On Thursday, a Los Angeles judge pushed back a highly awaited resentencing hearing, delaying the proceedings for at least the second time in order to decide whether a key report on the brothers was admissible.\n",
      "A two-day resentencing hearing was set to begin on Thursday in a packed courtroom in Los Angeles Superior Court. Now, a procedural hearing is scheduled for May 9. The court will grapple with the report and other matters before moving on to hear testimony about potential resentencing. The judge said part of the hearing on May 9 could be closed to the public.\n",
      "At issue: Whether the brothers should walk free more than three decades after they murdered their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in the den of their Beverly Hills mansion.\n",
      "The brothers have long said they did so because they were sexually abused by their father and feared that their parents would kill them to prevent the family’s secrets from being disclosed. They were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. A new, lesser sentence could see the brothers freed imminently.\n",
      "The move on Thursday by the judge, Michael V. Jesic, to push back the resentencing hearing was a momentary victory for the county’s top prosecutor, Nathan J. Hochman, who filed a motion late Wednesday night asking for the delay. Prosecutors had argued that the court should wait until it had secured the report, known as a risk assessment, before going forward with the resentencing hearing.\n",
      "That risk assessment was ordered by Gov. Gavin Newsom of California as part of clemency proceedings, a legal process separate from the resentencing. Prosecutors said the report, prepared by the state’s parole board, became available this week.\n",
      "Judge Jesic and the lawyers said there were conflicting messages from the governor’s office about whether the report should be used in the resentencing process. On the one hand, the governor has claimed the report falls under executive privilege and should not be made public; on the other, the governor’s office has invited Judge Jesic to review the report.\n",
      "Judge Jesic adjourned the hearing for more than two hours at one point Thursday afternoon so he could seek clarity from the governor’s office. “This is stupid,” Judge Jesic said shortly before he left the bench.\n",
      "When he returned, he said the risk assessment would be made available to him and to the brothers’ lawyers. But he said it was not clear whether the information in the report would be admissible in court. The lawyers on both sides will argue over that issue on May 9.\n",
      "The judge must also deal with escalating tensions between lawyers for the brothers and Mr. Hochman’s prosecutors.\n",
      "At a hearing last week, prosecutors, without warning, showed a graphic crime scene photo while the family was in the courtroom. The family subsequently filed a complaint against Mr. Hochman, saying the move had violated a victims’ rights law and had traumatized members of the family. Terry Baralt, the 85-year-old sister of the brothers’ father, was hospitalized as a result, the family has said.\n",
      "Habib Balian, the lead prosecutor in the case, said that moving forward he would give notice before he showed any crime scene photos, but added that “Erik and Lyle caused that carnage.”\n",
      "And on Thursday in court, lawyers for the brothers said they planned to file a motion seeking to force the district attorney’s office to recuse itself in the resentencing matter. Bryan Freedman, a lawyer for the Menendez brothers, accused Mr. Hochman of having a “personal bias” in the case. He said that at the time of the 1989 murders, Mr. Hochman lived close to the crime scene and attended the same high school as the brothers.\n",
      "“His personal bias in this is seething through every action that has been taken,” Mr. Freedman said.\n",
      "Throughout the proceedings, Mr. Hochman’s team has insisted its work is not politically motivated and has argued that it is necessary to highlight the depravity of the brothers’ crime.\n",
      "The murders happened on the evening of Aug. 20, 1989, when the brothers burst into the den of the family home with shotguns and repeatedly fired at their parents as the couple watched television and ate ice cream.\n",
      "In the aftermath of the killings, the brothers told the police they suspected that either the mafia or his business associates had killed their father, and soon went on a spending spree with the family’s money, buying clothes, sports cars and luxury watches.\n",
      "They were arrested the following spring, and their trial in 1993 became one of the first to be broadcast to a national television audience. That initial trial, in which the brothers were tried together but each with a different jury, ended in a mistrial. They were tried again with no cameras present and strict limits on some of the testimony imposed by the judge.\n",
      "The brothers were convicted after that second trial.\n",
      "As their years in prison passed, the story of the Menendez brothers endured in popular culture through numerous scripted series and documentaries. Two high-profile projects recently brought forward by Netflix — a dramatic series by the producer Ryan Murphy and a documentary — lent momentum to fresh legal efforts to have the brothers’ convictions and sentences re-examined.\n",
      "While the brothers’ claims that they had been sexually abused by their father were, at the time of their trials, downplayed or dismissed by prosecutors and mocked by late-night comics, evidence unearthed in recent years has supported the claims, and has helped attract new backers to the brothers’ cause. Younger supporters have tapped into the evolving cultural attitudes about sexual abuse and the trauma it inflicts, organizing social media campaigns on the brothers’ behalf.\n",

      "In that shooting, a burst of gunfire sent hundreds of bystanders fleeing or hiding among bookshelves at Strozier Library in the middle of the fall semester. The gunman, a 31-year-old graduate named Myron May, wounded two students and a library employee who survived.\n",
      "The gunman had reloaded once before he was killed by the police outside the library building, the authorities said at the time.\n",
      "The gunman had believed the government was watching him, and that he had detailed his fears in a written journal and videos, officials said at the time. He had no criminal record with the Tallahassee Police Department or the Leon County Sheriff’s Office, the authorities said in 2014.\n",
      "The police chief at the time, Michael DeLeo, credited security measures that allowed only students and staff to enter the library with preventing more bloodshed. The gunman had been carrying a .38-caliber handgun and additional ammunition in his pockets, but he left the library after he was unable to make it past the security barriers, Chief DeLeo said then.\n",
      "One of the students who was injured, Farhan Ahmed, was left paralyzed after the shooting, according to WTXL , a TV station in Tallahassee. In 2019, Florida State University and Mr. Ahmed reached a $1 million settlement, The Tallahassee Democrat reported .\n",

      "The Ivy League university balked at the government’s demands a day after the president launched a move to begin stripping it of its tax-exempt status , escalating a stand-off with one of the country’s most august institutions.\n",
      "In discussions over dinner with a group of pastors on Wednesday evening, the US president said no final decision had been made on changing Harvard’s tax status.\n",
      "But he lashed out again at the university, calling it a “disgrace”. He added: “They are obviously antisemitic, and all of a sudden they are starting to behave.”\n",
      "Harvard on Thursday said it would “not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights” and stressed: “We will continue to comply with the law and expect the administration to do the same.”\n",
      "US President Donald Trump: 'They're obviously antisemitic '\n",
      "The reaction followed a statement from Kristi Noem, Homeland Security secretary, late on Wednesday, in which she cancelled two grants totalling $2.7mn and said that by the end of April Harvard must submit detailed records on its “foreign student visa holders’ illegal and violent activities” or be stripped of its Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification to oversee student visas.\n",
      "Noem said: “Harvard bending the knee to antisemitism — driven by its spineless leadership — fuels a cesspool of extremist riots and threatens our national security.”\n",
      "She alleged “anti-American, pro-Hamas ideology” was “poisoning” the university’s campus and classrooms, adding that “Harvard’s position as a top institution of higher learning is a distant memory”.\n",
      "The university said: “Harvard values the rule of law and expects all members of our community to comply with university policies and applicable legal standards. If federal action is taken against a member of our community, we expect it will be based on clear evidence, follow established legal procedures, and respect the constitutional rights afforded to all individuals.”\n",
      "The threat to visas marks a fresh pressure point after the suspension of $2.2bn in federal grants this week following Harvard’s rejection of the White House’s demands for tight government oversight of its operations.\n",
      "It also reflects broader calls by Trump and several of his officials to declare war on the country’s elite universities.\n",
      "However, the threat will fuel the tensions within the government between Maga populists calling for tighter controls on all immigration and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs including Elon Musk who support H-1B visas for highly skilled foreign immigrants. H-1B visas are typically issued to international students choosing to stay in the US after completing their studies in the country.\n",

      "Eli Lilly’s new obesity and diabetes pill has shown it can lower blood sugar and aid weight loss in a late-stage trial, sending shares in the US drugmaker up nearly 15 per cent in Wall Street trading.\n",
      "Orforglipron uses the same GLP-1 mechanism as weight-loss and diabetes injectables such as Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Ozempic and Eli Lilly ’s Zepbound and Mounjaro.\n",
      "David Ricks, Eli Lilly’s chief executive, called it a “convenient once-daily pill”.\n",
      "While meeting demand for existing drugs has been challenging, Ricks said orforglipron could be quickly manufactured and “launched at scale” if it were approved by the regulator. The company expects to submit it for approval for weight-loss treatment later this year, and for diabetes in 2026.\n",
      "The phase 3 trial found the drug lowered blood sugar by an average of 1.3 per cent to 1.6 per cent and reduced body weight by an average of 8 per cent when taken at its highest dose. On average, the weight of trial participants had not plateaued at the end of the study, so they might be able to lose more if they used the drug for longer.\n",
      "Naveed Sattar, professor of cardiometabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, said these were “important results”, and having a new pill that lowers blood sugar and weight would be “critical to future type 2 diabetes care”.\n",
      "The positive results bolster Eli Lilly’s pipeline in obesity as the company races with rival Novo Nordisk to dominate the market. Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Ozempic still have the majority of the market share, but Zepbound and Mounjaro are quickly catching up.\n",
      "Novo Nordisk has had some disappointing results in its pipeline of obesity drugs. Late last year, the stock fell 21 per cent after it published phase 3 results for its drug CagriSema, showing it missed its goal of 25 per cent weight loss. Last month, a trial of the same drug in people with diabetes also disappointed.\n",
      "Other drugmakers are also trying to enter the market but earlier this week, Pfizer abandoned its attempt at creating a pill for weight loss after a patient in one of its trials experienced a “potential drug-induced liver injury”.\n",
      "In the Eli Lilly trial, there were no safety problems related to the liver. Patients experienced similar side effects to those commonly seen with the injectables, including diarrhoea and nausea.\n",

      "A Chinese satellite company linked to the country’s military is supplying Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen with imagery to target US warships and international vessels in the Red Sea, according to American officials.\n",
      "What the US said: The Trump administration has repeatedly warned Beijing that Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co Ltd, a commercial group with ties to the People’s Liberation Army, is providing the Houthis with the intelligence, according to the US officials. A senior state department official told the Financial Times that China had “ignored” the concerns. Tammy Bruce, the state department’s spokesperson, confirmed that CGSTL was “directly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on US interests”.\n",
      "Beijing’s role in the Red Sea: China has expressed concern about the Houthis’ attacks in the critical maritime route for global trade and the US navy. The Biden administration urged Beijing to use its leverage with Iran to rein in the Houthis — but officials saw no evidence that Beijing had done so. Asked about the US claims about CGSTL, the Chinese embassy in Washington said it was “not aware of the relevant situation”.\n",
      "What is CGSTL?: The Chinese company was established in 2014 as a joint venture between the provincial government in Jilin and a branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Changchun, the province’s capital. It has previously come under US scrutiny, and was among groups hit by sanctions in 2023 for allegedly providing high-resolution satellite imagery to Russia’s Wagner Group.\n",
      "“Chang Guang is one of a handful of ‘ostensibly’ commercial Chinese satellite companies that are in fact deeply embedded in the military-civil fusion ecosystem, supplying global surveillance capabilities to both civilian and military customers,” said James Mulvenon, an expert on the Chinese military and intelligence services at Pamir Consulting.\n",

      "In the first quarter, Netflix reported better than expected subscriber growth, which helped push its earnings up by 24 per cent. Viewers flocked to watch the psychological crime series Adolescence, live streams of WWE wrestling and Back in Action starring Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx.\n",
      "Netflix announced last year that it would no longer disclose its quarterly subscriber figures, long a crucial metric for investors.

      "Bankers had expected the US IPO market to explode back to life under a Republican administration following a three-year dry spell, but several closely watched listings, including liquefied natural gas exporter Venture Global and data centre operator CoreWeave, earlier this year met with lukewarm investor interest.\n",
      "Several other large offerings were postponed shortly after Trump’s so-called “liberation day” tariff announcements on April 2, though broader market turbulence had not stopped “a wave” of 24, mostly microcap, Chinese companies from listing in the US this year, said Matthew Kennedy, a senior strategist at Renaissance.\n",
      "Chagee’s prospectus lists “trade disputes” and changing US “foreign investment laws” as crucial risk factors.\n",
      "Goldman Sachs this week highlighted growing concerns that Trump may force Chinese companies to delist from US stock exchanges, writing in a note to clients: “In an extreme scenario, US investors may have to liquidate $800bn worth of holdings in Chinese stocks.”\n",
      "A person close to Nasdaq told the Financial Times the exchange had not heard from the White House on the matter.\n",
      "Some market participants had questioned why Chagee, which hopes to expand overseas, chose the US, given rival Chinese tea companies Guming and Mixue have surged since they went public in Hong Kong in February and March, respectively.\n",
      "Those concerns appeared overblown on Thursday as Chagee’s stock surged, however.\n",
      "Chagee’s business in China was booming, according to the company’s IPO prospectus. It ran 6,440 tea houses — 97 per cent of which are in China — at the end of last year, up 83 per cent on 2023, while net revenues rose 167.4 per cent year on year to just under $1.7bn.

      "A US federal judge has ruled Google illegally acquired and maintained a monopoly in digital advertising, the latest antitrust defeat for the technology giant that could result in it being forced to divest parts of its business.\n",
      "Leonie Brinkema, the district judge presiding over the case in Virginia, on Thursday said Google had “wilfully” monopolised two parts of the digital advertising market: the technology online publishers use to sell ad space, and the biggest exchange on which businesses bid for ads.\n",
      "However, Brinkema found the US Department of Justice, which brought the case, was not able to prove Google unfairly dominated the third component of the market, advertiser ad networks.\n",
      "The ruling comes after a federal judge in a separate antitrust case last year found the company spent billions of dollars on exclusive deals to maintain an illegal monopoly on search.\n",
      "The second phase of that trial, in which the court will determine remedies that could include forcing Google to sell parts of its business, begins next week.\n",
      "The DoJ asked in the search case for Google to sell its Chrome browser , cease $20bn in payments to Apple each year to be its default search engine, and share more data with rivals.\n",
      "Brinkema on Thursday wrote: “For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.”\n",
      "“Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anti-competitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features,” she added.\n",
      "But she rejected the way the DoJ had tried to define the third part of the market, saying the term “advertiser ad network” was uncommon in the industry and “unduly exclude[s]” publishers.\n",
      "Google said: “We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half . . . We disagree with the court’s decision regarding our publisher tools. Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.”\n",
      "The ruling is the latest win for the former antitrust officials appointed by ex-president Joe Biden who brought and litigated the case before Donald Trump returned to the White House.\n",
      "Jonathan Kanter, the former head of the DoJ’s antitrust unit, said in a post on X on Thursday: “Today is a huge victory for antitrust enforcement, the media industry, and the free and open internet . . . Google is now an illegal monopolist twice over.”\n",
      "Antitrust officials appointed by Trump have strongly signalled they intend to adopt a tough stance on enforcement, especially against Big Tech. The US Federal Trade Commission this week began making its case against Meta in a monopoly trial in Washington federal court.\n",

      "“This is a landmark victory in the ongoing fight to stop Google from monopolising the digital public square,” US attorney-general Pam Bondi said in a statement. “This Department of Justice will continue taking bold legal action to protect the American people from encroachments on free speech and free markets by tech companies.”\n",

      "Kyiv and Washington have signed a memorandum of intent pledging to advance an agreement on an investment fund for Ukraine’s natural resources and energy assets, officials familiar with the matter told the Financial Times.\n",
      "The officials said the memorandum had been signed “virtually” and they hoped to finalise the full economic accord as early as the end of next week.\n",
      "Yulia Svyrydenko, first vice-prime minister and economy minister, confirmed the signing, posting a photograph of herself with Treasury secretary Scott Bessent each in their respective offices.\n",
      "“Today we took a step towards a joint economic partnership agreement with the United States,” she said, adding the memorandum “testifies to the constructive joint work of our teams and the intention to finalise and conclude an agreement that will be beneficial to both our peoples”.\n",
      "She said the full agreement would “open up opportunities for significant investments, modernisation of infrastructure, and mutually beneficial partnership between Ukraine and the United States”.\n",
      "What Ukrainian officials said signalled “positive steps forward”, gets what has been a challenging negotiation process back on track. Talks were derailed following the confrontation between Presidents Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump in the White House in February.\n",
      "Speaking at a briefing on Thursday prior to the signing, Zelenskyy said US negotiators had proposed an interim step as a gesture of goodwill, while legal teams from both sides continued to work on the details of the full accord.\n",
      "“This is a memorandum of intent — not the agreement itself — but it reflects our constructive and positive intentions,” he said.\n",
      "Later on Thursday, during a meeting with Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in the Oval Office, Trump said his administration was planning to sign the full agreement on natural resources and energy assets next Thursday.\n",
      "Bessent later clarified, however, that details were still being finalised, with the aim of signing by April 26, next Saturday.\n",
      "He added the deal was substantially the same as one previously negotiated, where Zelenskyy and Trump had not signed a memorandum of understanding. Ukrainian officials, however, said they have managed to bring the agreement more in line with their preferences.\n",
      "Ukrainian officials familiar with the matter said the sides were expected only to report progress by ​April 26, ​after Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal’s visit to Washington, with the goal of concluding discussions and signing shortly thereafter.​\n",
      "They said it was possible to sign the full deal then but it would not be clear until negotiations were finalised over the coming days.\n",
      "“I assume they’re going to live up to the deal​,”​ Trump said.\n",
      "Trump has advocated for a ​broad deal granting the US preferential access to Ukraine’s natural resources including critical​ minerals ​and rare earths , framing it as compensation for ​the billions of dollars in military aid supplied​ to Kyiv under Joe Biden’s administration. However, Zelenskyy has been wary of signing a deal that does not include security guarantees.\n",
      "A draft of the ​US proposal sent to Kyiv​ last month and ​f​irst reported by the Financial Times went well beyond a joint economic accord outlined in February. The proposal marked a sharp escalation of Washington’s demands​ while offering Kyiv no security guarantees in return​.\n",
      "Senior Ukrainian officials warned the deal ​as written could threaten national sovereignty, divert profits abroad and increase dependence on the US.\n",
      "Recommended\n",
      "The proposal covered all mineral resources , including oil and gas, and called for a supervisory board with US veto power to oversee a fund splitting revenues from energy and mineral projects between the two countries.\n",
      "​Since then, Kyiv has hired the US law firm Hogan Lovells to work with Olha Stefanishyna, deputy prime minister and justice minister, to negotiate a better deal with the US, according to Ukraine’s government and a Foreign Agents Registration Act filing reviewed by the FT.\n",
      "Ukrainian officials familiar with the matter told the FT that progress had been made to walk back some of the most contentious US demands, which could have kept the deal from being ratified by the country’s parliament. However, they declined to provide specifics while negotiations were under way.\n",
      "The matter has been so sensitive that Zelenskyy launched an investigation into the leak of the latest US proposal for profiting from the Ukrainian assets, which included the use of polygraph tests on government officials.\n",
      "Once finalised, the agreement will need approval from Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada.\n",

      "Donald Trump has said there would “100 per cent” be a trade deal with the European Union, in a rare show of optimism about his relationship with Europe as he met Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in the White House.\n",
      "Meloni, who has forged a strong personal rapport with Trump, was in Washington on Thursday to try to head off any escalation of the US president’s trade war and tariffs on the EU.\n",
      "“Oh there’ll be a trade deal, 100 per cent,” Trump said, referring to the single market. “They want to make one very much, and we’re going to make a trade deal, I fully expect it and it’ll be a fair trade deal.”\n",
      "Trump’s comments marked a shift in tone after he and his top advisers have disparaged the EU as “pathetic”, while accusing the bloc of “ripping off” the US.\n",
      "Meloni also struck a note of confidence about the progress on talks to strike a deal, just over two weeks after Trump announced tariffs on trading partners including the EU.\n",
      "“I’m sure we can make a deal and I’m here to help on that,” said Meloni, who has urged Brussels not to escalate the trade war, but to negotiate instead.\n",
      "She also said Trump had agreed to visit Italy, and that she would try to arrange for him to meet other European leaders during his trip.\n",
      "“The goal for me is to make the west great again — and I think together we can do it,” she said, citing their common “fight against woke ideology”.\n",
      "Trump showered praise on Meloni, calling her “a great talent” and “one of the real leaders of the world”.\n",
      "But the US president has refused to engage with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, with whom Meloni was in close contact ahead her trip.\n",
      "EU and US officials began talks this week about Trump’s tariffs on imports from the block, which are now set at 25 per cent on steel, aluminium and cars, and at 10 per cent on all other exports.\n",
      "Washington has threatened to reinstate a 20 per cent tariff on imports from the EU within 90 days if the talks fail.\n",
      "However, EU trade negotiators have complained they were not presented with the US’s demands, something officials hope the Italian leader can clarify.\n",
      "Meloni “has an advantage on the EU mediators — she is talking to the decider”, said Stefano Stefanini, Italy’s former ambassador to Nato.\n",
      "He said her meeting with Trump could be useful for the EU to find out what he wanted. “The US trade representative doesn’t really know [that]“, Stefanini added.\n",
      "“When you engage Trump on the basis of ‘national interest’, that’s his favourite language,” Stefanini said. “He might not give in, but it is something that he understands. If you talk to him about transatlantic solidarity, that is a waste of time.”\n",
      "Senior US officials said ahead of the meeting that Trump would discuss defence spending, as well as Italy’s digital services tax, which trade officials argue discriminates against US companies.\n",
      "“President Trump is clear to all leaders around the world when it comes to trade, his expectation is policies . . . that recognise a true partnership and give access to world’s markets on behalf of the American manufacturing,” an official said.\n",
      "“We’re open, we’re available, we’re ready to make deals with countries that take this seriously,” he added.\n",
      "But Trump on Thursday also boasted of the income generated by his tariffs. “We’re making a lot of money, we’re taking a lot of money,” Trump said. “We’re taking in billions, and billions of dollars.”\n",
      "The US is Italy’s second-largest export market, and tariffs would put further pressure on Italy’s already sluggish economic growth. “We know we are in a difficult moment,” Meloni said ahead of her trip. “We will do our best, as always.”\n",
      "Meloni indicated at the White House that Italy would buy more LNG from the US, Italian companies would invest up to €10bn in the country, and Rome would soon announce that it was fulfilling its Nato commitment to spend up to 2 per cent of GDP on defence.\n",
      "Trump gave little public hint of his demands of the EU in exchange for rolling back the tariffs. “I am not a big fan of Europe and what they’ve done with immigration,” he said. “They’ve got to get smart.”\n",
      "Stefanini said Washington could press for Europe to further distance itself from China. “If the EU makes a deal with the US, it will be forced to further de-risk or decouple from China as a consequence. It’s either China or the US.”\n",
      "Recommended\n",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has hoped to capitalise on Brussels trade tensions Washington, suggesting China and the EU should “jointly resist unilateral bullying”. But Meloni has long been wary of China, which she views as a strategic rival of the west, and in 2023 she formally withdrew Italy from Xi’s flagship Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\n",
      "While some EU member states are irked by Italy’s soft stand on retaliatory tariffs, officials in Brussels officials supported her trip. “We are aware that she has a relationship with Trump and that can be valuable,” said one diplomat.\n",
      "Lucio Malan, a senator from Meloni’s rightwing Brothers of Italy party, said Meloni showed “courage” by talking directly to Trump, given that trade policy is Brussels’ competence.\n",
      "“It would have been simpler to stay home, and say ‘after all, it’s EU business’,” Malan said. But Meloni has “chosen another way”.\n",
