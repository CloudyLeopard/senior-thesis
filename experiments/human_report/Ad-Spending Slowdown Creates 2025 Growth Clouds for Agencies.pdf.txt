Ad-Spending Clouds Loom in 2025
Read Research Report: Global Advertising 2025 Outlook
Ad-Spending Slowdown Creates 2025 Growth Clouds for Agencies
Contributing Analysts Geetha Ranganathan (Media)
(Bloomberg Intelligence) -- Global advertising agencies like WPP, Publicis, Omnicom and Interpublic
may need to work harder for top-line gains in 2025 as brands' campaign-spending growth slows
amid an uncertain economic backdrop and potential tariﬀ wars. GDP headwinds and consolidation
point to rivalry being the greatest in the US, the world's No. 1 advertising market. (12/11/24)
1. Global Ad Spending Set to Slow in 2025, US in Focus
The latest GroupM forecasts point to a 7.7% expansion in 2025 global-advertising spending to $1.1
trillion, a slowdown vs. 2024's expected 9.5% gain (excluding political campaigns). The WPP-owned
media agency anticipates digital ads (70%-plus of total spending) will continue to drive growth,
rising 10% in 2025. There's also evidence of retail media's rising popularity as advertisers shift
budgets away from brand building toward sales activation. That's likely a reﬂection of weaker
consumer sentiment pressuring marketers to ﬁnd ways to encourage spending. TV's inﬂuence is
likely to wane further, up just 1.9% in the year, even with greater demand for connected-TV and
streaming inventory.
GroupM expects 2025 growth to slow in both the US (7%) and China (10.3%), accounting for
combined global ad-spending of about 53%. (12/11/24)

4. Tech Pullback Brings Client-Sector Exposure Into Focus
The abrupt and deep ad-spending pullback by large technology companies in 2023 has brought
client-sector exposure into the spotlight. The reverse hampered WPP the most prompting a series
of downgrades to its full-year sales-growth outlook. A muted rebound in tech-sector spending in
2024 has hampered the UK agency most but all the big agencies are likely reviewing the balance
of their client exposure as they try to avoid a similar slip-up. Havas growth was hit by healthcare
client losses in 2024.
According to GroupM estimates, consumer-related companies (retail and staples) account for the
largest share of global ad-spending (28.6%) followed by technology-related companies (15.5%).
Media and entertainment clients account for 7.4% of spending followed by ﬁnancials (6.5%), autos
(4.8%) and healthcare (3.4%). (12/08/24)

5. Outsized US Exposure Could Give 2025 Headache
Growing clouds over the economy in the US could pose a fresh headache in 2025 for some big ad
agencies -- including Omnicom, Publicis and Interpublic -- as they all rely on that market for a large
share of their sales. The IMF expects real GDP growth in the world's largest advertising market
(37% share) to ease 60 bps in 2025 to 2.2%, making it one of just a handful of only so-called
"advanced economy" to register a slower pace of expansion. The IMF's updated outlook for global
economic activity in October, anticipates that real global GDP growth in 2024 and 2025 will hold
steady at 3.3%.
A balanced exposure to all major countries and regions could be the best way for ad agencies'
ﬁnancial performance to be shielded from unanticipated economic shocks, but is only likely to be
achieved quickly for some via M&A. (12/08/24)

6. Proﬁt Recovery Outstripping Sales Rebound for Some
Sales growth and a renewed focus on cost cutting mean that underlying net proﬁt at Omnicom,
Publicis and Interpublic is rebounding at a faster pace than sales compared with 2019's pre-
pandemic baseline. That's as the companies' operating models undergo substantial and permanent
change. WPP's eﬀorts to rationalize its roster of agency brands may ultimately yield a more
pronounced boost to proﬁtability. Dentsu's "one company" simpliﬁcation plan mirrors an earlier
move by Publicis to de-emphasize individual brand silos.

The reluctance to cut back on head count during the pandemic limited big agencies' ability to
absorb proﬁt pressure from a double-digit slump in 2020 sales. Staﬀ costs typically make up 60-
65% of total overheads, so agencies may look to generative-AI platforms to help bolster medium-
term productivity. (12/09/24)
