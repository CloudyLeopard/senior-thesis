       "{'Impact of password sharing on subscription services': [(Document(text='\\nSonja Hutson, Joshua Franklin and Cristina Criddle\\nThis is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘ AI that can control your computer’\\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\\nSonja Hutson Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Thursday, October 24th and this is your FT News Briefing . There’s more bad news for Boeing. And US lenders are trying to close the door on open banking. Plus, over in AI, a new virtual agent could run your life for you.\\nCristina Criddle It can schedule calendar appointments for you. These kind of tedious things that take us quite a long time to do.\\nSonja Hutson I’m Sonja Hutson, and here’s the news you need to start your day.\\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\\nBoeing workers voted to reject a deal with the company yesterday. That means the nearly six-week strike will continue.\\xa0The deal would have increased pay by 35 per cent over four years and improved retirement benefits. But workers wanted a 40 per cent raise and for the company to restore a defined benefit pension plan they previously lost.\\xa0It’s a blow to Boeing’s new CEO and his plan to stabilize the business.\\xa0The company reported a $6bn loss last quarter and said it would continue to bleed cash.\\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\\nThe US has announced new rules that will make sharing bank information a little bit simpler. They’re called open banking regulations and they’ll help customers connect their accounts to apps like Venmo or PayPal. But big banks are not a fan. Here to tell us more is the FT’s Josh Franklin. Hey, Josh!\\nJoshua Franklin Hi there.\\nSonja Hutson OK, so give me the rundown on these new rules. What are we talking about here?\\nJoshua Franklin So these are kind of clear guidelines. Rules of the road for how banks should allow their customers to connect and share their data with third-party apps. So things like Venmo and PayPal. And also facilitate consumers having access to kind of share their financial history — things like transaction histories, account balances and payment details. With the hope that if it’s easier to do that, it’ll make it easier for you to switch banks if you’re not happy with the service you’re getting at the bank you have right now.\\nSonja Hutson So these new regulations would help me easily transfer data from my old bank to my new bank. And they’d also make it easier to use apps like Venmo. But I guess I’m wondering — I mean, I’ve been using Venmo for years — why is this all happening now?\\nJoshua Franklin Yeah, these rules have been almost 10 years in the making. They’ve come out of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the US, the CFPB. And that’s an agency that’s gone through a little bit of ups and downs over the last kind of eight years with the change of presidential administration. And these rules have just been hard to iron out and figure out. And so in the meantime, this practice has still been going on. So you’ve got kind of sometimes best practices being used or what’s seen as being good practices. And other times the practices are a little bit more questionable. And this is particularly true in the case of what’s known in the US as screen scraping, where you’ll share your login details for a third party to use your account details. They’ll basically just copy and paste the financial information that they need. And that’s seen as not being terribly secure and a safe way to do it. So now what these current rules are doing is just kind of establishing a clearer and hopefully more secure way of doing that.\\nSonja Hutson And Josh, how do the banks themselves feel about these regulations?\\nJoshua Franklin They have taken issue with the rules. So much so that they’ve actually taken the unusual step of suing the CFPB to try to block them from happening. They claim that this actually risks endangering customer data by making data more accessible for third-party apps that maybe the banks would argue don’t have terribly strict security controls.\\nYou know, and I think there’s definitely an element of the banks kind of talking up their own book here. Given that there is some anxiety that by introducing more competition — which is the goal of the CFPB rule — it makes it harder for banks to hold on to clients and also opens the door more to threat from potential newer companies that are offering kind of financial technology products to clients.\\nSonja Hutson What have analysts told you about where this lawsuit from banks could be going? I mean, is there a chance it could actually overturn the CFPB rule?\\nJoshua Franklin It’s still very early days but there’s definitely a feeling among some analysts who have taken a close look at this that the banks might actually have a strong case. And you know, potentially the door could close on open banking just as quickly as it opened.\\nSonja Hutson Josh Franklin is the FT’s US banking editor. Thanks, Josh.\\nJoshua Franklin Thanks very much.\\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\\nSonja Hutson Deutsche Bank delivered some mixed news in its earnings report yesterday. The German lender saw record profits last quarter. That’s thanks to revenues from its trading and investment advisory businesses. But it also warned investors to brace for higher-than-expected loan losses next quarter. Deutsche Bank blamed that on the commercial real estate crisis and some, quote, larger corporate defaults. Its chief financial officer did say those issues should disappear next year, though.\\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\\nKeeping up with day-to-day tasks can be a bit of a time suck. But it’s a fact of life, right? Well, not according to AI start-up Anthropic. On Tuesday, it unveiled a new computer use feature for its model, Claude. It says this tool will enable Claude to basically act like a personal assistant and control your computer. The FT’s Cristina Criddle has been following this new era of virtual agents. She joins me now. Hi, Cristina.\\nCristina Criddle Hi.\\nSonja Hutson So can you walk me through how this computer use feature works, exactly?\\nCristina Criddle So most tasks that you can do on your computer, Claude can do for you. And that includes like quite mundane tasks like filing expenses or booking travel. So you would put an instruction into Claude — much like you would if you were interacting with the chatbot interface — and ask it to do a task for you. But the types of tasks it can do now are controlling your mouse and keyboard. So it can browse the internet and do research. It can schedule calendar appointments for you. It can fill in forms and it can transfer data from one document to another. These kind of tedious things that take us quite a long time to do, but wouldn’t take your computer that long to do if you instructed it in the right way.\\nSonja Hutson Got it. And how unusual is Claude’s new feature? I mean, I’m assuming other AI companies are working on something similar.\\nCristina Criddle This is the first time I’ve seen a feature like this. It is quite unusual and I would say a big step. It feels at the moment like every tech company is announcing their version of AI agents, though. Microsoft announced some recent autonomous agents in its 365 product suite and then OpenAI recently launched developer access to some of its voice models.\\nSo one example demoed by OpenAI was where you would ask the chatbot to find you locations that would sell strawberries near you. And then you could select the business and ask the chatbot to order you a certain amount of strawberries for a certain price. And it would call this business and put in the order for you using its voice. And so this is kind of the next frontier. Many of the AI companies are calling it for this technology, but we’ve yet to see widespread development and implementation into our lives yet.\\nSonja Hutson OK. So admittedly, I will say having a bot do this admin that I usually really dislike doing, it does sound really great. But I’m also wondering what are the risks of letting a robot program your life, basically? I mean, Claude messing up a flight booking, for example, feels a lot riskier than a chatbot just spurting out nonsense.\\nCristina Criddle It can make mistakes and even that was one of the things that was highlighted by Anthropic when they were demoing this feature, was that it might still click on a website in its search that isn’t that reliable. So it is in its early stages. The company warned that and they say it’s kind of like self-driving cars at the moment where consumers don’t really trust it to drive on its own. And it’s very much still got to have your hands on the wheel making sure that those kind of mistakes aren’t happening or if they do happen, you’re able to step in.\\nSonja Hutson And Cristina, I feel like we can’t ignore how very human-like this all sounds. I mean, it seems like we’re racing ahead really quickly with AI developments. Is anyone concerned about these agents getting too powerful?\\nCristina Criddle It is human-like. But we have interacted with technology to make these experiences easier for us already. I think there is a wider concern about if these models reach artificial general intelligence — which is intelligence at the same level as most humans — and that’s what a lot of these companies hope to achieve. If that happens, then maybe there’s cause for concern because the level of control that you have over those systems is still unclear and those safeguards haven’t been put in place yet.\\nSonja Hutson Cristina Criddle is the FT’s technology correspondent.

The shares rose 5 per cent in after-hours trading.\\nThough tightening the use of passwords has boosted subscriber growth, analysts are raising the question of when that effect will tail off. Subscriber growth in the quarter outpaced expectations but it was significantly lower than in the same quarter last year.\\nHits in the quarter included new series such as The Perfect Couple , Nobody Wants This and Tokyo Swindlers, it said.\\nTed Sarandos, co-chief executive, said on a call with analysts that he was “feeling really good” about the business next year.\\nNetflix is investing heavily in live sporting events such as WWE’s Monday Night Raw and NFL American football holiday games, with such live-streamed content seen as providing an “appointment to view” for subscribers and differentiating it from rival streamers in the pursuit of new viewers.\\nIn a letter to shareholders, Netflix said: “We’ve delivered on our plan to reaccelerate our business, and we’re excited to finish the year strong with a great Q4 slate, including Squid Game [series two], the Jake Paul/Mike Tyson fight and two NFL games on Christmas Day.”\\nForrester Research director Mike Proulx said: “With every quarter, Netflix looks more and more like linear TV. The company is on a live programming rampage right now that has everything to do with courting ad dollars in order to diversify its sources of revenue.”\\nFor the full year of 2024, Netflix said it expected revenue growth of 15 per cent — the high end of its forecast range — and an operating margin of 27 per cent. Operating margin was 30 per cent in the third quarter, higher than the 22 per cent hit a year before.\\nNetflix will stop reporting subscriber numbers next year as it seeks to shift investor focus to revenues and profits.\\nRecommended\\nA crackdown on password sharing has boosted income, and the company has introduced lower-priced tiers of subscription where programming comes with advertising. Netflix said membership with ads was up more than a third quarter on quarter but it had “much more work to do improving our offering for advertisers, which will be a priority over the next few years”.\\n“We’re pleased that we’ve reaccelerated our growth and, as we head into 2025, we expect to deliver solid revenue and profit growth by both improving our core series and film offering while investing in new growth initiatives like ads and gaming,” the Netflix letter said.\\nFor 2025, the company is forecasting revenue of $43bn-$44bn, which would represent growth of 11-13 per cent from expected 2024 revenues. Operating margin is anticipated to be 28 per cent, against the 27 per cent expected for 2024, but that “after delivering outsized margin improvement in 2024, we want to balance near-term margin growth with investing appropriately in our business”.', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/2e7c984d-8f28-46b4-9253-9a77c0b40f07', 'title': 'Netflix’s third-quarter revenue and subscriber numbers beat expectations', 'publication_time': '2024-10-17T21:47:24.184Z'}, uuid=UUID('b2dd3907-5af6-4f50-951c-8f83c387a610'), db_id=''),\n",

Both pleaded not guilty on Friday.\\nParliament has different bodies responsible for various parts of its operations. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) handles payroll for MPs staff, but the aides are legally directly employed by their MPs. IPSA is separate from the Parliamentary Digital Service, which handles email systems.\\nTwo ex-aides said parliamentary authorities did not automatically close email accounts when a staffer’s employment ended.\\n“To close an account, the MP or office manager has to inform Parliamentary Digital Services directly the person has left,” one of the aides said.\\n“If the MP is disorganised, or just a new MP with limited training on running their office, then it’s very possible that an account may remain for months until security clearance expires,” they added.\\nA third former staffer added: “You go through such a rigorous security process to get your pass, it’s mad they don’t restrict access to parliamentary accounts as soon as you leave.\\nThe Labour party, which swept to power at the July UK general election after 14 years in opposition, last month privately warned its parliamentary staff about the risk of access by ex-employees.\\nIt said in an email to all Labour parliamentary staff that it was “vital” that staffing records were kept updated so that anyone who had left Westminster was immediately prevented from receiving information.\\nThe party added that only one member of each MPs office should be on internal mailing lists at any given time to prevent confidential information being leaked.\\nRecommended\\nMany former MPs’ staff move into lobbying roles upon exiting parliament. These jobs frequently involve contacting parliamentarians — often the ones who formerly employed them — on behalf of commercial clients.\\nThis year hundreds of aides left parliament largely because of the July general election, when 175 Conservative MPs lost their seats.\\nA House of Commons spokesperson said: “Network accounts sponsored by MPs are audited throughout the course of every parliament, with accounts closed and access to the parliamentary estate removed, as soon as we are told to by either the sponsoring MP or by IPSA.”\\nThey added: “Individual MPs, as the sponsors of their staff and owners of the data, are required to inform us of any changes or closures.”\\nThe IPSA said: “Parliamentary accounts are administered by [the] Parliamentary Digital Service, and IPSA sends data on a weekly basis confirming any members of staff whose leaving date has passed.”', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/c1d646db-f11f-424c-abcd-b9e1a582e0cc', 'title': 'Lobbyists access parliamentary emails using IT loophole', 'publication_time': '2024-10-06T11:15:14.816Z'}, uuid=UUID('873dfb79-4205-4d49-b9b9-d0423d1e256d'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nChristopher Grimes in Los Angeles\\nNetflix’s leadership team looked shaken. The blistering 10-year growth streak that had made it a Wall Street darling came to an abrupt end in the spring of 2022 with the revelation that it was losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers.\\nThe streaming wars were at fever pitch, with Disney+ and other services launched by the established Hollywood studios all gunning for Netflix. Speaking to stunned investors on a video call on April 19 2022, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings began rattling off initiatives to reverse the slide.\\nNetflix would start cracking down on customers who shared their passwords with friends or relatives, an idea he had opposed in the past. Another proposal that Hastings had long dismissed — advertising — was now on the cards.\\nTo some viewers, it seemed like Hastings was throwing spaghetti at the wall in the hope that some of it stuck. The stock plummeted, marking the start of what became known as “the Great Netflix Correction”.\\nBut instead of being the comeuppance that many in Hollywood’s old guard had been praying for, it marked the beginning of a strategic shift that has expanded Netflix’s lead over the traditional entertainment companies, which are still struggling to make money in the business after pouring billions into streaming.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nSince launching its password crackdown in May 2023, Netflix has added 45mn paying subscribers. Its share price has risen more than 300 per cent from its post-correction low, recently setting new all-time highs.\\nSuch a rebound was hardly assured in 2022. But since then, Netflix has launched an ads business from scratch, invested in its nascent video games division and expanded its live “experiences” around popular shows such as Bridgerton , Squid Game and Stranger Things . It has even started dipping into live sport.\\n“It’s just been incredible execution,” says Jessica Reif Ehrlich, a veteran media analyst at Bank of America.\\nShe notes that the new initiatives were all started while Netflix was navigating a major management change.\\xa0Hastings retired as chief executive in 2023 and was replaced by a protégé, Greg Peters, who shares the role with Ted Sarandos.\\xa0“This must be the smoothest transition of any management team ever,” Ehrlich adds. “There hasn’t been even a blip.”\\nThe disdain for Netflix is beyond anything I’ve ever seen . . . They dominate and control everything\\nWhile Netflix regained much of its swagger, the traditional Hollywood groups have been mired in a funk. The Netflix correction marked the end of investor patience for streaming losses, and Disney is the only one of the legacy entertainment groups currently making any money in that business after turning profitable this summer .\\nThe movie industry is weathering another difficult year, prompting concerns about whether the box office will ever sell as many tickets as it did before the pandemic. Cable television — once a prodigious cash flow generator — is in a deep decline, and many doubt that streaming will ever replace its moneymaking power.\\nTaken together, these pressures contributed to Shari Redstone’s decision this summer to sell Paramount, a company her family controlled for decades. Around the same time, BofA analyst Ehrlich took the unusual step of publicly imploring Warner Bros Discovery’s management to explore strategic options, declaring that its “current composition as a public company is not working”.\\nThese problems have washed over Hollywood’s creative community in the form of job cuts and reduced production budgets, while the rebound that many had hoped for after last year’s strikes by actors and screenwriters has not materialised.\\nA longtime TV writer and producer confirms the grim mood. “There is not a writer in this town who thinks their career is going well,” he says. “Everybody is up against it right now because the jobs are just not there.”\\nMeanwhile, Netflix’s soft power is rising in Hollywood. Sarandos is chair of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, and oversaw Netflix’s recent $70mn renovation of the historic Grauman’s Egyptian Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. His wife, Nicole Avant, is a longtime friend of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. In an old-school flex, Netflix even purchased all the billboards along the Strip on Sunset Boulevard.\\nBut some in Hollywood are angry at the company for radically changing the economics of the entertainment business. Some voting members of the Academy remain aggrieved that Netflix does not give its Oscar-contending films a wide release, preferring limited screenings in select theatres for only the minimum time required to qualify for an Academy Award.\\n“The disdain for Netflix is beyond anything I’ve ever seen,” says a Hollywood veteran who has held top positions at major entertainment companies. “They have eliminated the backend financial [profit] participation of every artist in the world. They dominate and control everything, and no one’s even close.”\\nHe adds: “The city is bleeding right now. Bleeding.”\\nHastings may have sounded like he was riffing when he made his announcements about password sharing and selling advertising.\\nBut in reality he and other senior managers had been discussing the ideas for years, current and former employees say. To get them up and running, Hastings turned to Peters, then the chief operating officer.\\nLike Hastings, Peters came from a tech background. His mother was a computer programmer at IBM who made sure he learnt to code at the same time he learnt to read and write. Before joining Netflix in 2008, he had worked for Tivo and Red Hat Network.\\nThere was scepticism about the password crackdown as Peters began launching controlled tests in markets such as Chile, Costa Rica and Peru in early 2023. Some analysts thought the initiative would end up losing customers for Netflix.\\nInstead, it proved to be a boon that turbocharged Netflix’s growth for more than a year, with total subscribers reaching 277.6mn in the most recent quarter, up 16.5 per cent from a year earlier.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nNearly five years after the launch of Disney+ ignited the streaming wars, Netflix remains on top in terms of both subscribers and time spent on the service. In July, it captured about 8.4 per cent of US screen time while its nearest Hollywood rival, Disney, had 4.8 per cent between Disney+ and Hulu.\\nStreamers run by the other Hollywood studios — Warner Bros Discovery’s Max, Comcast’s Peacock and Paramount+ — all had less than 2 per cent of viewing hours.\\nYet with the surge from the password-sharing crackdown starting to taper off, analysts are raising questions about the next leg of growth for Netflix. Its other big initiative — advertising — will take more time before it is a meaningful contributor to the bottom line.\\nNetflix partnered with Microsoft to use its “stack” — a system for delivering digital advertisements — and launched its ad-supported service in 12 countries by the autumn of 2022. It began publicly releasing a list of its top 10 shows, allowing advertisers to target the streamer’s most popular programmes.\\nBut Amazon, which competes with Netflix with its Prime Video service, also entered the streaming advertising business, and in typically aggressive fashion began offering rates much lower than those Netflix was seeking.\\nIn a move that shocked the industry the executive running the advertising business, Peter Naylor, left the company during this year’s annual “upfront” presentations. Soon after, Netflix said it would phase out its use of Microsoft’s “stack” and build an in-house advertising platform instead. The company now says that advertising will not be a “primary driver” of revenue growth until 2026.\\nDespite the setbacks, Ehrlich says she believes Netflix will be successful in the ad business once it is running at scale. One reason is the loyalty of Netflix’s audience. “They are like the old pay TV bundle, [where people watch] two hours a day, 60 hours a month,” she says. “So they can guarantee that they can reach consumers. The dollars follow the eyeballs.”\\nIn Hollywood and on Wall Street, there is an expectation that weaker streamers will either combine or shut down within the next 18 to 24 months. Yet even if there is a shakeout, there will still be an intense fight for eyeballs in the broader streaming audience.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nYouTube is mostly known for its user-generated content but is also pushing paid subscriptions for offerings such as NFL Sunday Ticket, which can cost about $480 per year.\\nTikTok is allowing its users to experiment with long-form video of up to an hour. And free streaming video sites such as Tubi, a service owned by Fox, are growing quickly on the back of older TV titles.\\n“Competition remains fierce not just within the category of subscription streaming, but also against the broader category as a whole,” analysts at MoffettNathanson, a research firm, wrote recently. “YouTube already accounts for over 20 per cent more TV usage than Netflix and is growing at a faster rate. Short form video is also here to stay.”\\nBefore the Netflix correction , the company was known in Hollywood for paying well-known directors or showrunners huge sums to make movies or series.\\nThis helped it win audiences early on with edgy programmes such as Orange is the New Black and House of Cards . Its content budget soared, bankrolled by investor enthusiasm for buying new shares in the then-lossmaking company.\\nNow that they’re the dominant player . . . they can take advantage of their market share\\nTo the fury of the Hollywood establishment, Netflix rejected the studios’ system of profit participation, known as backend, whereby directors and actors take a smaller amount of money upfront in exchange for a cut of the gross revenue if a movie is a box office success.\\nBut it handsomely rewarded top directors such as Martin Scorsese for his three-hour mafia epic The Irishman , or showrunners such as Shonda Rhimes for bodice-ripping period drama Bridgerton and Ryan Murphy for serial killer anthology Dahmer .\\nThe lavish spending appears to have topped out, at least for now. “Now that they’re the dominant player, they don’t have to pay people extra to be in business with them, right?” says the longtime producer and writer. “Now they can take advantage of their market share.”\\nAfter the subscriber declines in 2022, Netflix capped its content budget at $17bn, though spending fell to $13bn during the Hollywood strikes last year. The company also discovered that its subscriptions kept growing during the strikes, even without much fresh programming.\\n“They still had incredibly strong subscriber growth and they were not suffering when it came to their engagement numbers — they were still doing fine while the traditional TV businesses were really struggling,” says Jamie Lumley, an analyst at Third Bridge, a research firm.\\nThe pressures of the strike also prompted legacy media groups to resume licensing their shows to Netflix, which they had stopped after they launched their own streaming services. Old shows were revived by the “Netflix effect” — most notably Suits , starring Meghan Markle , which became the most streamed programme of 2023.\\nThe lesson Netflix took away from the strike experience, Lumley adds, is that it does not have to produce as much new programming as it had been. “That gives them flexibility to take some bigger swings on different kinds of content,” he says. Company officials say they will increase content spending from $17bn in the future, but haven’t given a timeframe.\\nIt has become known for popular lower-cost fare like its “unscripted” programming, mainly reality shows such as Love is Blind , Selling Sunset and Is It Cake?, and experiments with live streaming, which debuted with a glitchy standup routine by comedian Chris Rock in March. Analysts see live streaming as a gateway to real-time professional sporting events and other programming that could increase audience engagement.\\nNetflix’s live-event capability will face its biggest test yet on Christmas Day, when it will stream an NFL game. The move has prompted speculation that it may seek to join Amazon and Apple in the race for sports rights, though Sarandos insists he is not interested in paying for full-season rights in which most of the financial benefit goes to the other partner.\\nPerhaps the most interesting move by Sarandos since the Netflix correction has been a $5bn, 10-year deal with World Wrestling Entertainment’s weekly Raw programme in the US. It is the group’s biggest foray into streaming live events, and could form a framework for Netflix if it ever enters into a deal with a professional sporting league.\\n“Wrestling historically has a very engaged fan base, and this is weekly content,” Lumley says. This kind of recurring programming means Netflix does not have as much pressure to “keep their foot on the gas in the traditional production engine”, he adds.\\nBut for some, the wrestling deal indicates a shift from the higher-brow offerings of the early days. “If someone is defining quality as being sophisticated, literary scripted programming, then Netflix is not specialising in that the way they were a few years ago,” says Robert Thompson, professor at the Newhouse School at Syracuse University.\\n“What wrestling does, what live stand-up comedy does, has value in itself. It’s just different from a sophisticated, scripted show.”\\nFor all the gripes about programming quality , Netflix still came out of last weekend’s Emmy awards with 24 winners, including four for Baby Reindeer — though it was beaten into second place overall by Disney’s production unit FX, creator of hit series such as Shogun and The Bear .\\nThe ultimate prize in Hollywood, the Oscar for Best Picture, has eluded Netflix despite multimillion-dollar marketing campaigns for its eight nominated films since 2019, which include Roma , The Power of the Dog and All Quiet on the Western Front .\\nWhether it will continue aggressively pursuing prestige films became a live topic in Hollywood this year after the departure of Scott Stuber, who led the company’s film division and actively recruited top filmmakers to make Oscar-worthy movies during his seven-year tenure.\\nAddressing speculation that his successor, Danny Lin, might veer from Stuber’s strategy, Sarandos said there was “an unlimited appetite to make better films, always”. The company points to Emilia Pérez , this year’s winner at Cannes, and an adaptation of August Wilson’s The Piano Lesson as proof of its commitment to sophisticated films.\\nBest Picture award or no, and despite the threat from free streaming, Netflix has for now cemented its position at the top of a wounded Hollywood.\\n“Every decade has a dominant media company,” says a senior executive at a Hollywood rival. “And Netflix is it for this decade.”\\nThis article has been amended to reflect that Jamie Lumley is an analyst at Third Bridge, not Third Point.

The universal service obligation to deliver six days a week may finally get the tweaks that Royal Mail has long desired. This introduces another hurdle for Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský’s £5.3bn takeover bid.\\nThe communications regulator on Thursday said it would look at changes to the delivery of second-class letters, while leaving first class unaltered. That means it is considering almost exactly the proposals that Royal Mail submitted earlier this year — the best sign yet that change is coming. If enacted, this could rejuvenate Royal Mail’s beaten-down owner International Distribution Services.\\nThe issues with the USO are simple. Falling letter volumes mean it costs too much to maintain deliveries at the current rate. IDS shares were trading below their 2013 IPO price before the bid’s arrival.\\nThe company has suggested that its proposals would save £300mn of costs. Reform would mean IDS is worth substantially more than the 360p per share in cash that Křetínský is offering.\\xa0The deal falls over then, surely?\\xa0Not so fast.\\nShareholders face a difficult decision. The deal is being reviewed for regulatory approval. If it gets the all-clear, investors will get the chance to tender their shares in the first quarter of 2025. Ofcom also plans to publish its consultation earlier next year, with a decision in the summer.\\nThe complicates the position of long-term investors, some of whom have already voiced their opinion that the offer is too low. The improved odds of USO reform would only cement that sentiment.\\nBut Křetínský’s use of a tender offer means he can set his threshold for success as low as just over 50 per cent of the register. Křetínský has just over half that amount himself.\\nThe support of long-only funds may be questionable but arbitrageurs are near guaranteed to tender in favour, says Mark Kelly of MKP Advisors. Those now make up a tenth of IDS’s disclosed register and more likely represent 15 per cent. That figure could rise to as much as 30 per cent of the total.\\nThat would be enough to get Křetínský across the line and give him effective control. It leaves open the possibility that Křetínský could keep the business listed, perhaps dampening talk of him snatching a UK crown jewel on the cheap. However, he still needs to clear national security hurdles.

Nationwide is set to buy Virgin Money for £2.9bn, the largest M&A deal in UK banking since the financial crisis. The Co-operative Bank will also return to mutual ownership in a merger with Coventry Building Society.\\nBuilding societies say their ownership structure means they can act with their customers’ best interests in mind rather than to please shareholders. But what does this mean in practice?\\nNot all customers of building societies are automatically counted as members. Membership is free and automatic for customers who hold qualifying products but eligibility varies according to each building society. Customers with a savings account or a mortgage generally qualify, while Nationwide, the largest building society, also counts current account holders.\\nRegardless of the size of a member’s savings or mortgages, building societies operate on the principle of “one member, one vote” during their annual general meetings. There are restrictions, however, including for people under the age of 18 or with less than £100 in savings.\\nBuilding societies say they are able to invest their profits to benefit customers rather than to reward shareholders through dividend and share buybacks. One example of this is Nationwide’s “fairer share” payments through which it will distribute £100 in payouts to 3.85mn of its 16mn members this year. Other societies use profits to keep savings rates high or mortgage rates low and to invest in their local communities.\\nWhile the big banks are retreating from the high street, mutuals’ share of the branch network has doubled over the past 10 years.\\nThe main perk of being a member is the ability to attend AGMs to vote on proposed changes to societies’ rule books, elect and re-elect directors as well as ask questions of the board.\\nAGMs also include advisory votes on executive pay. Last month, about 95 per cent of voting members approved the tripling of Nationwide chief executive Debbie Crosbie’s maximum long-term bonus to £3.4mn.\\nMembers can also request resolutions to be discussed and voted on ahead of the meeting. However, this is subject to certain exemptions. Member-proposed resolutions must have enough support from other members. The board may also reject “frivolous or senseless” resolutions, according to the BSA.\\nThis year, Nationwide members sought to put the building society’s planned takeover of Virgin Money to a members’ vote. But they were blocked from doing so as the society insisted it was not required. James Sherwin-Smith is running for election to the board after having campaigned to put the takeover to a vote. He said: “The democratic power of the mutual ‘one member, one vote’ governance model has been steadily eroded” as many customers are unaware of their rights.\\n“The degree of influence that the membership has on society affairs is dependent on how active the membership is — if members are passive, and don’t exercise their powers, the organisation becomes increasingly autocratic,” he said, flagging a low turnout at Nationwide’s latest AGM.', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/21279fc0-78e5-4c9c-b10e-7d0b9c2c4059', 'title': 'What does it mean to be a building society member?', 'publication_time': '2024-08-02T15:18:53.573Z'}, uuid=UUID('aa6d7b08-41c1-45fe-899a-e8ef8ad15974'), db_id=''),\n",

Now it needs to win the advertising one.\\xa0That will be easier said than done.\\nThe company remains the undisputed leader in video streaming. Last week, it threw up another big quarter of subscriber and revenue growth, adding more than 8mn net new subscribers from April to June. Revenue rose 17 per cent to $9.6bn while net income jumped by nearly a third.\\nFuelling the growth was last year’s decision to crack down on password sharing and introduce a lower-priced subscriber plan with advertising. Hit shows such as Bridgerton and Baby Reindeer also helped attract viewers.\\nAt a time when rival streaming services are struggling to gain customers and make a profit, Netflix , with its 27 per cent operating margin and robust free cash flows, is the envy of the sector. Its shares have traded accordingly. The stock, up 35 per cent over the past 12 months, hit a new high this month. At about 30 times forward earnings, it commands a premium over rival streaming operators.\\nBut the subscriber surge from the password crackdown cannot last. User growth will slow. This could come as soon as the next quarter, with tougher comparatives from last year. Netflix plans to stop reporting quarterly subscriber numbers starting next year.\\nIt’s a questionable move that may backfire. Without insight into subscriber growth, investors will be forced to focus on other metrics. Netflix will need to start making more money from advertising to maintain its share price gains.\\nThe problem is Netflix is still a minnow in advertising. While YouTube and Amazon have well-oiled ad machines, Netflix is only starting to build its own ad-tech platform. Analysts at Emarketer forecast Netflix will generate $760mn in advertising revenue this year. That would translate into just a 2.7 per cent market share of the so-called connected TV ad business. Hulu and YouTube each have 12 per cent, while Amazon has 11 per cent.\\nNetflix’s cheaper, ad-supported tier has over 40mn global monthly active users. It needs to work harder to monetise these customers. That means showing more ads, or even introducing ads to its other ad-free tiers. At Amazon’s Prime Video, showing ads is the default mode. Customers have to pay more to avoid ads.\\nBut people pay for Amazon Prime for free delivery. Video is just gravy. Netflix customers will have less tolerance for ads, and for being asked to pay more to stay ad-free. After years of pitching itself as an ad-free alternative to traditional TV, Netflix faces its toughest battle yet.\\npan.yuk@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/77d72ba7-5f08-4ba4-b6bd-6c2a94a8a635', 'title': 'Netflix faces tough battle in advertising wars', 'publication_time': '2024-07-22T08:35:39.188Z'}, uuid=UUID('68f056fb-876b-480f-b5d1-9a2162c9c811'), db_id=''),\n",

But the company warned that new subscriber additions in the current quarter would be lower than a year ago, when its crackdown on password sharing went into full effect.\\nEarnings rose 48 per cent to $4.88 a share on revenue of $9.6bn, beating Wall Street forecasts. Netflix also lifted its revenue estimate for the full year, which it said “reflects solid membership growth trends and business momentum”.\\nNetflix said its advertising tier now accounts for 45 per cent of sign-ups in markets where it is available, but it doesn’t expect it to be a “primary driver of revenue growth” until 2024 or 2025. Sign-ups to the ad tier rose 34 per cent from the previous quarter. Netflix’s strength contrasts with the continued growing pains for the legacy studios’ streaming services , which are either unprofitable or making only modest amounts of money. In a letter to shareholders, Netflix noted the struggles of its rivals, saying “while they are investing heavily in premium content”, they are seeing “relatively small viewing on their streaming services and linear [TV] continues to decline”.\\nGreg Peters, Netflix co-chief executive, said the “number one priority is gaining scale” in its advertising business, which it was doing by hiring new sales people and building its own ad platform to replace the current Microsoft system. “That unlocks a whole set of innovations, a better user experience and better ad features,” he said. Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said that achieving scale in the ad business had taken longer than expected, especially given Netflix’s “wealth of data on viewing attitudes and habits”. “It is up against even bigger tech giants with a huge base and scale,” he said, mentioning Amazon, Meta and Google. “This is clearly taking Netflix a lot longer given its small ad base.”\\nNetflix has been adding one-off sports events to its programming, including a golf tournament, an upcoming fight featuring Mike Tyson and two American football games at Christmas — leading Wall Street to ask whether it would sign a deal with a sports league.\\nTed Sarandos, co-chief executive, threw cold water on the idea of a big sports contract. “It’s very difficult to have big-league sports and profit when you have entire seasons,” he said. “Making these Netflix [sports] events, we’re not taking on a lot of tonnage. These are economics we like and can live with.”\\nRecommended\\nAsked about artificial intelligence , Peters said Netflix had been using technology “similar to AI” to help drive more engagement with its users, adding that new generative AI technology “can improve discovery and recommendations” for its customers.\\nSarandos said the impact of generative AI on the creative community was “hard to predict”.\\n“A lot of filmmakers and producers are experimenting with AI today and we’ve got to see how that develops,” he said. “We have to focus on quality of storytelling.”', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/f151d1fe-64ad-4342-a548-98b94c107be3', 'title': 'Netflix earnings surge on boost from ‘Baby Reindeer’ and ‘Bridgerton’', 'publication_time': '2024-07-18T22:00:44.709Z'}, uuid=UUID('6b1567f8-0976-40ff-a3e5-9efc514eeda4'), db_id=''),\n",

That marked the highest total since the borrowing frenzy of 2021, when interest rates were practically non-existent.\\nDespite that huge wave of new issuance, massive demand for new corporate debt — fuelled by yield-hungry investors — has helped to keep a lid on borrowing costs. On average, junk-rated borrowers pay just 3.09 percentage points to issue debt over US Treasury yields, Ice BofA figures show, down from 3.9 percentage points a year ago. High-grade bond spreads average just 0.93 percentage points, down from 1.28 percentage points.\\nIn essence, markets have been very accommodating, making it easier for US companies to borrow, even before the Federal Reserve begins to cut interest rates from their 23-year highs. Exemplifying that openness, the Chicago Fed’s National Financial Conditions index last week reached its loosest level since November 2021.\\nWhy do we care? Well, some might worry that these figures reflect over-exuberance in credit markets, which could ultimately encourage too much risk taking — meaning lenders fail to exercise necessary caution, complacently funding companies with weak growth prospects that might ultimately struggle to service their debt.\\nAs Citigroup’s Michael Anderson puts it: “We care about financial conditions because they have important implications for growth, important implications for monetary policy and also for future default rates. If financial conditions get too loose, and lenders get over their skis in terms of risk, we could see a spike in default rates.”\\nOverly loose conditions might also dissuade the Fed from making the two or three quarter-point rate cuts this year that markets are currently pricing in.\\nHowever, the financial conditions picture is more complex than the broad metrics cited above suggest. At an index level, things might look very loose — but under the surface, I’m inclined to agree with Anderson that it’s truly a “mixed bag”.\\nFor one thing, as he highlights, overall leveraged buyout activity has picked up this year — but it’s still well below the highs seen in the immediate aftermath of the Covid crisis, when central bank stimulus fuelled a borrowing frenzy.\\nIn fact, the share of junk bond issuance in the first half of this year done purely for refinancing purposes was its highest since 2009, as companies and their private equity backers chose to roll over old debt instead of feverishly pursuing M&A deals.\\nAt the same time, while debt issuance did get off to a roaring start this year, weaker borrowers have failed to join the party to the same degree. Issuance of US junk bonds ranked triple-C or lower by at least one rating agency — the bottom end of the credit quality spectrum — totalled just $11bn in the first six months of 2024, according to PitchBook LCD data. That was up slightly from 2023’s very muted levels, but down more than one-third from the same period a year earlier.\\nBy contrast, issuance of junk bonds rated double-B or single-B jumped by about three-quarters in the first half of this year to roughly $150bn.\\nSo, the borrowing window has stood wide open in 2024, unless you’re a company with very risky debt, facing numerous macroeconomic and idiosyncratic problems. A couple of sectors repeatedly pointed to in relation to such challenges include healthcare and telecoms.\\nI’d argue that signs of careful credit selection — and general avoidance of weaker companies — are also evident in the secondary market, where investors trade assets with each other.\\nThe average spread for a US junk bond rated triple-C or lower sits at roughly 9.3 percentage points, up from 9.2 percentage points a year ago. By comparison, bonds rated double-B — the highest rung of high-yield — pay an average borrowing premium of 1.8 percentage points, significantly lower than a level of 2.5 percentage points last July.\\nInvestors do appear to be treading (or trading) more carefully than those overarching gauges of borrowing conditions would imply. Looking at the data, accusations of blind enthusiasm would be unfair, or at least premature.\\nThat may give way to less caution, of course, if and when the Fed eventually chooses to cut rates. However, there’s also an argument that a rate cut could prove restrictive for borrowers who have benefited from loose conditions up until now.\\nAs Anderson at Citi points out, if the central bank does opt to ease monetary policy, private-equity sponsors might feel inclined to chuck more debt supply at the market — creating a technical hurdle that pushes overarching credit spreads wider, and counter-intuitively making it more expensive for companies to borrow.\\nRemember, he says, that “this cycle is not normal; things are turned upside down relative to what they have been historically, so you can’t just rely on one or two simple metrics to get the whole picture”.\\nWords that could be applied to a number of asset classes and scenarios these days.\\nKen Griffin has bought a stegosaurus fossil called “Apex” for $45mn.

       "  (Document(text='\\nTry to buy anything these days and shoppers are inevitably encouraged to sign up to a loyalty programme.\\nRewards schemes are proliferating. Globally, one in three of the businesses that do not currently operate loyalty schemes will do so by 2027, says consulting firm Gartner. Companies that have long offered programmes are also sweetening the rewards. US retailer PetSmart added premium tiers to its loyalty scheme this month.\\nWhat appears good for shoppers has perks for investors too. An academic study based on 322 companies with loyalty programmes found both long and short-term benefits. Sales rose 7 per cent on average in the first year of a scheme’s introduction and gross profits 6 per cent, according to the 2019 research by academics from Michigan State and Oakland universities in the US.\\nAt their simplest, loyalty programmes offer a pact with consumers: keep coming back to us, leaving a data trail each time, and in return you will receive points that can be swapped for goods and services.\\nTheir very longevity implies effectiveness. Frequent-flyer points have been around since the 1970s. Trading stamps, a precursor, began life in the late 19th century. So, too, does the increasing complexity of many schemes, with different tiers and discounted prices. The addition of membership fees is also increasing. These have been found to increase usage.\\nYet some schemes have started to attract unwanted attention. The UK’s competition watchdog has launched a probe into loyalty cards at two of the country’s biggest supermarkets — Tesco’s Clubcard and Sainsbury’s Nectar — over concerns of “two-tier” pricing. The former has more than 20mn members, the latter 18mn-plus. In the US, the Department of Transportation is looking into frequent-flyer programmes at major US airlines.\\nAny effort to restrict programmes is likely to be unwelcome for shareholders, although in the case of supermarket schemes that offer special prices for loyalty card holders, they have already achieved the aim of increasing market share.\\nSome airlines, selling air miles to credit card providers, have turned points into a bigger money-spinner than the far more volatile business of flying.\\nLoyalty programmes feed through to the bottom line in several ways. First, repeat custom is cheaper than bringing new customers on board. That story is told most graphically by the massive cash burn at consumer-facing start-ups as they woo customers with freebies and steeply discounted goods or services. Even the relatively mature Deliveroo spent 9 per cent of revenues on sales and marketing last year.\\nThe troves of data on spending habits garnered by providers helps them to cross-sell and provide tailored deals: for instance, marketing ready meals to a buyer of newborn nappies or plant-based burgers to vegan shoppers.\\nGranted, this can go wrong on occasion. One notorious example is when Target of the US used predictive analytics on shopping patterns to work out pregnancies and even due dates, and sent off baby coupons to a teenager who had not disclosed her condition to her father.\\nThese data caches can also be monetised by selling them on — in anonymised format — to third parties. Sainsbury’s expects its Nectar360 business, which runs its loyalty programme, to generate £90mn of incremental profits by March 2026. US bank JPMorgan, although not actually selling the data, is charging brands to target their ads at its retail customers based on their spending history.\\nThat suggests shoppers should not be the only ones watching their points accumulate, as more companies spin out the concomitant data into its own money-making unit.\\nSupply disruptions have sent cocoa bean prices to remarkable heights. Chocolate makers are melting. Shares in the world’s largest, Switzerland’s Barry Callebaut, have lost a third since the start of 2023.\\nSome relief arrived for the group’s investors this week with better than expected first-half results . Yet commodity volatility means the sweet taste is unlikely to last long.\\nThe biggest concern for investors, of course, is consumers buying less chocolate .\\nTraditionally, that has not been a problem at Barry Callebaut. It is well known for its inelastic demand even though its prices have been rising for years. Its prices are up some 20 per cent since the start of 2021. Volumes over that time have been flat. Surprisingly, volumes remained resilient in the six months to February, rising 1 per cent.\\nElsewhere, there are definite signs of strain. Working capital in particular is squeezed. This jumped by SFr800mn over the six months and contributed to negative free cash flow of SFr1.1bn. As a result, net debt jumped to SFr2.6bn — almost three times ebitda. Barry Callebaut has refinanced its debts and expanded revolving credit facilities.\\xa0It aims to offset the impact of higher bean prices with cost savings.\\nCocoa prices may remain high even though fears of inadequate supply look overblown. A stocks-to-use ratio of more than 30 per cent is high compared with the previous bull market in 1977 when that figure fell to 18 per cent, notes Jonathan Parkman of broker Marex.\\nThe cocoa market has since evolved. Big chocolate makers now seek premium grades to make good on sustainability promises.\\xa0Spot prices are stuck at record levels because of producers’ fears of running out of the right kinds of higher-quality beans. On top of that, buyers are staying out of forward markets in Ghana due to the country’s financial crisis and debt default.\\nBoth factors will keep spot prices higher for longer. This will continue to drip debt on to chocolatiers’ financials.', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/56db7f30-2d63-451a-81bd-e3743f5ffe96', 'title': 'Loyalty schemes pay for shoppers and shareholders', 'publication_time': '2024-04-12T11:00:49.334Z'}, uuid=UUID('a7e41da4-3d51-4f6f-b430-33eb9ab1c4d9'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nSoumaya Keynes\\nLast November, Meta started offering users in the EU a new version of Facebook and Instagram. In exchange for as much as €12.99 per month, the company promised neither to process data for personalised adverts, nor to show any ads at all. I dislike being hounded to buy stuff, and watched with envy. Could changing the way we pay for social media make it better?\\nThe current model involves us exchanging our time, attention and privacy for cat videos and jealous girlfriend memes. We all pay eventually, as ad spending is ultimately built into prices. Including the likes of Google and Amazon, in 2022, Britain’s average digital ad spend was a little over £900 per household.\\nThis system’s main benefit is that it is accessible to those without much cash. Personalisation should save people from scrolling through irrelevant ads (Car insurance! Package holidays! Zimmer frames!). Some economists have even argued that targeted digital advertising has increased the variety of stuff Americans consume.\\nSuppose though that regulators woke up one morning feeling meddlesome. Suppose they announced a ban on “free” ad-supported services, no more tracking and no more temptations to buy an avocado slicer late at night in the hope it will transform your life.\\nRegulators would (of course) still allow platforms to make money. Some would have a head start in the subscriptions business. Alphabet claims that YouTube, for example, squeezes more value from its paying subscribers than the ad-supported sort.\\nHard evidence of what might happen is thin. One recent working paper argued that switching to a subscription-based model could mean platforms try harder to give users a good time, rather than maximising eyeballs on ads and short-term engagement. It refers to an experiment in which hiding (user-defined) “toxic” content on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter (now X) reduced the time people spent there. But on Twitter it increased the number of retweets, which they see as a sign of an improved user experience.\\nIt is possible that making people pay upfront would help with the problem of “digital addiction”. Although many people are happy with their social media use, one study estimated that about a third of it is the result of self-control problems. Those less immune to “digital fentanyl” might be grateful for an upfront price to give them pause.\\nAn even more intrusive regulator concerned about people consuming more online content than they really want could mandate a model in which people paid for what they watched. Retailers would never get away with an “all you can smoke” offering. If vendors of viral videos faced similar constraints, perhaps they would be associated with fewer feelings of regret.\\nI doubt any social media executives are praying that my noodling makes it into the real world. And there are good reasons to be sceptical that a switch to a subscriber model would make much difference. Competition between platforms provides strong incentives to keep users engaged. And Matthew Gentzkow of Stanford University, one of the authors of the digital addiction study, points out that part of the focus on short-term engagement is that longer-term measures of welfare are hard to find.\\nThe recent example of Meta introducing paid-for versions of Facebook and Instagram suggests that incremental change is unlikely to have major effects. There is no evidence of a subscription rush, or of any difference in the surface-level user experience, beyond the lack of ads.\\nIndeed, everyone seems miffed. Regulators are asking questions about how the “pay or consent” model was implemented, including whether consumers faced “pressure” to accept the ads option. In February, a European consumer protection group complained that the move was a “smokescreen” for problematic data processing. Meta itself has stated its philosophical objections to charging, and that it is simply trying to follow “overlapping EU regulatory obligations with differing compliance deadlines”.\\nLive discussions include whether the implicit price of the existing advertising model is too high. That comes amid growing chatter about the virtues of “contextual adverts”, based on a web page’s content rather than a viewer’s profile. Another is whether the cost of the alternative is low enough. Meta has offered to lower the price to €6 a month but faces queries from the European Commission about how exactly the new offering works.\\nWhoever would have thought that a simple economic tweak might not solve a complicated problem? Perhaps if I spent less time glued to my phone, I would have worked it out sooner.\\nsoumaya.keynes@ft.com\\nFollow Soumaya Keynes with myFT and on X', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/529e44a8-15a5-4a98-9c1c-05d9a0984c09', 'title': 'Would a subscription model make social media better?', 'publication_time': '2024-03-22T05:00:19.748Z'}, uuid=UUID('5478e97f-d3ca-4145-b5e7-7d94b99edc54'), db_id=''),\n",

UGH .\\nA new study by crypto tax software CoinLedger reveals that the retail & e-commerce sector has the highest number of companies that offer the option to purchase through cryptocurrency.\\nThe study compiled a list of 400 major companies listed by BitPay as accepting cryptocurrency methods and categorized them into sectors, to discover which one contains the most companies offering crypto as a payment method.\\nRetail & e-commerce take first place with a total of 76 companies accepting crypto payments. The sector includes clothing and accessories stores like Adidas, Yankee Candle and H&M, as well as online shopping platforms such as Etsy.\\nAdidas and Etsy told us they don’t accept crypto payments. Yankee Candle and H&M didn’t respond to our emails.\\nThe food & dining sector follows closely in second with 72 companies. Examples are Chipotle, Chuck E Cheese’s, Domino’s and Hard Rock Café, and delivery services such as DoorDash and Uber Eats.\\nUber Eats and Domino’s UK told us they don’t accept crypto payments. Chipotle said it accepts digital payments including with crypto through Flexa-enabled apps. We’re still waiting to hear back from the others, though going by their websites we can guess their response.\\nWhat’s going on here? Mostly, it’s gift cards. H&M, Domino’s and Uber Eats are listed above because Bitpay resells their gift cards for crypto .\\nPrepaid cards were being used as shadow currency long before bitcoin was invented. Their current and continuing popularity in crypto (and other communities ) is because prepaid offers many advantages over on-chain tokens.\\nUnlike crypto, an electronic retail voucher can be redeemed near-anonymously, instantly, at face value. Use will usually fall below the purview of financial regulators. Purchases and transfers are largely untraceable. Trust rests in a central counterparty, with a multinational corporation acting both as the custodian and the clearing house. Sales are VAT-exempt and the reporting of capital gains is a matter of personal conscience.\\nA recently released 2010 email from Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s pseudonymous chief architect, predicted that prepaid cards could be a bridge to tradfi. Crypto was easy to generate and hard to cash out, Nakamoto reasoned, but prepaid debit cards might offer the unbanked a convenient off-ramp.\\nThat gift cards would become currency for traders unwilling or unable to buy crypto through conventional channels was a less anticipated development. An investigation published by The Intercept in 2018 described how users were swapping bitcoin for gift cards on peer-to-peer marketplaces at a premium to the market price.\\nMany retailers have since tightened security on card purchases, including by putting restrictions on top-ups and blocking the purchase of cards with cards. Regulatory efforts have focused on warning about consumer confidence scams and limiting opportunities for money laundering .\\nMeanwhile, in the thriving gift cards-for-crypto sector, know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering measures are being applied unevenly.\\nOther popular cards-for-crypto sites include Bitrefill of Sweden, which says unverified customers can make up to 15 purchases a day to a value of $5,000, or $10,000 a month. Coinsbee , based in Germany, says in its FAQ that it applies no KYC checks below €1,000 per transaction up to a total value of €10,000. Live On Crypto, an alt-coin issuer that says it supports food banks, bought space on CoinTelegraph last week to advertise that its gift-card shop asks for “ no personal information on sign-up and checkout ”.\\nLast week, shortly after we enquired about its KYC and AML policies, US-based Bitpay posted on its website that transaction thresholds for unverified customers were $3000 for payments and $1000 for refunds, with an additional $1000 cap applying for customers based in the European Union. At press time the company had not responded to our requests for comment.\\nAmong big centralised crypto exchanges, only Binance offers crypto gift cards having launched a product in June 2023 . (It added a customer verification requirement on sales and transfers nearly two months later .) Coinbase has stopped selling prepaid cards and no longer supports a cashout-by-card function it launched in 2018. FTX sold gift cards in select Gamestop stores as part of a partnership, but that died along with FTX.\\nNevertheless, it’s still possible to buy crypto with prepaid cards. Specialist peer-to-peer marketplaces such as LocalCoinSwap offer the trade, as do sellers on forums including Reddit’s r/giftcardexchange board.\\nPaxful, the US-based P2P marketplace named in the Intercept article, allows crypto sellers to accept as currency up to 133 brands of gift card. A dollar in Walmart vouchers typically buys about $0.85 of bitcoin on Paxful, or $0.50 of ether, with worse rates quoted by sellers who don’t require receipts or physical delivery.\\nPaxful says it applies all relevant KYC requirements . Its website blocks incoming traffic by IP address to abide by US regulatory controls and applies a $1000 lifetime value cap on customers the company has verified only by phone.\\nWhile crypto is gradually being legislated into the financial mainstream, gift card law can look behind the curve.\\nElectronic money laws in the US, UK and EU apply only to general-use prepaid debit cards. Vouchers tied to a single retailer (known as closed-loop cards) are considered instruments of stored value, not payment instruments, so their sellers can avoid many of the reporting requirements placed on money transmitters.\\nAnd attempts at tightening regulations face strong opposition. Trade groups including the Electronic Money Association and EuroCommerce have called for the EU not to make gift card customer identification mandatory as part of an update of AML rules .\\nThe EU proposed in February that any exemption would be “conditional to strict limits regarding the maximum value of the product, its exclusive use to purchase goods or services, and provided that the amount stored cannot be exchanged for other value.”\\nTighter caps on gift-card values would be unlikely to have much effect on customers of Adidas, Chuck E Cheese’s, Yankee Candle and Hard Rock Café.

Its share price leapt 18 per cent higher.\\nAs an industry disrupter AJ Bell’s success comes down to the low fees it charges for execution-only services. Pre-tax profits of £88mn rose 50 per cent last year. It is the interest rate spread that AJ Bell makes on customers’ cash — rather than fees — which drives its profit growth. Even so, that will catch the eye of regulators concerned with good customer outcomes.\\nSome content could not load.

Cash in accounts on its platform for investment advisers is low at just 3.6 per cent of assets. It is higher on its retail platform at 13.3 per cent of assets.\\xa0Neither figure surprised brokerage analysts. But regulator scrutiny could still force these levels down over time.\\nAJ Bell does offer its clients better rates on these balances. A partnership with savings marketplace Raisin gives AJ Bell’s customers access to some of the most competitive deposit rates for UK notice and term accounts. AJ Bell also pays between 1.95 per cent and 2.45 per cent on cash balances held in dealing accounts and share ISAs.

As a result, customers will be able to share that data with third parties — which will be subject to limits on how they use it — or revoke access to the data at any time.\\n“With the right consumer protections in place, a shift towards open and decentralised banking can supercharge competition, improve financial products and services, and discourage junk fees,” argues CFPB Director Rohit Chopra.\\nThis right to control your data is one reason it is much simpler to change banks in, say, the UK, than in the US. “Account ownership is sticky in the US, where you are more likely to get divorced than to switch bank accounts,” observes John Pitts, the global head of policy for US fintech Plaid, and a former CFPB official.\\nSuch portability of personal data, says Pitts, would also allow consumers to pick and choose “different products that either their bank doesn’t offer or [does] offer but someone else offers a version that better matches your need”. A customer would be able to use those more suitable products without leaving their main bank.\\nCountries to watch 2023-2027\\nVietnam The success of local payment network NAPAS has boosted digital payments growth, with cardholders expected to more than double by 2027\\nAustralia The real-time payment network PayTo, launched last year, will see increasing adoption over next five years as new use cases emerge\\nSaudi Arabia Fintech is a key aspect of the country’s goal of payments among individuals to be 70 per cent digital by 2025\\nSingapore\\nThe city-state’s authorities have bold ambitions for a QR-code based payment system\\nSource: FT-Omdia Digital Economies Index\\nOpen banking began as a UK government initiative in 2018, as part of Europe-wide efforts to foster competition and innovation, and break the stranglehold of legacy providers on personal finance. The biggest British banks were forced to share their customers’ data with third parties such as fintechs for the first time, under the authorisation of those customers.\\nFive years in, the results vary. Progress in achieving the aims of Europe’s Payment Services Directive Two, which implemented open banking in the EU, has been “disparate”, according to Daniel Jones, a partner at law firm Orrick who specialises in technology and finance.\\n“There are many, many jurisdictions I think in the EU that aren’t meeting the expectations set by the law,” he says.\\nEven the country that started it all has gone only so far. Jones says that, in the UK, the reforms have only had an effect on bank accounts and credit cards. “We are yet to really unlock the potential, which is the ability to compare things like mortgages or pensions,” adds Jones.\\nWhat happens in the US is therefore being keenly watched. While there is already widespread use of fintech apps that make use of customers’ data from other financial firms, that information is often gathered through “screen-scraping”, whereby bots copy it from a website using the customer’s log-in details. This can be unreliable and carries risks, including having more data than necessary taken by the third party.\\nIn the US, the new open banking rule will require that, as in the UK, banks provide application programming interfaces (APIs), which allow data to be easily shared. The CFPB says its rule will “require data providers to establish and maintain a developer interface for third parties to access consumer-authorised data”.\\nIn the UK, the huge cost of implementing the technological changes fell solely on the big banks, and not on the fintechs who stood to benefit from access to their networks — which caused conflict.\\n“I’m aware of certain large deposit-taking banks that have spent over half a billion [pounds],” says Jones.\\nIn the US, the problem is that, while Wall St institutions can bear the costs, there are thousands of small and medium-sized providers that might struggle. The CFPB notes that “there are more than 9,000 banks and credit unions across the country, most of which serve as data providers, as do numerous non-depository financial institutions”. Making all those financial institutions work seamlessly together is likely to be a Herculean task.\\nAccording to the Fintech Brain Food newsletter, written by commentator Simon Taylor, the fact that the CFPB rule does not let banks charge for API access “will further reinforce the perception that open banking has zero upside for incumbents and all downside”. He proposes some form of revenue-sharing, in which banks could receive a small transaction fee when customers use open banking via third parties.\\nHowever, the Consumer Bankers Association, which represents retail banks, has welcomed the new rule, which also seeks to regulate fintech companies. “Many of these entities that are collecting, storing and selling this consumer information are not subject to the same rigorous data security and privacy standards as well-regulated and supervised financial institutions,” it pointed out.\\nAnd the Financial Technology Association — the fintechs’ lobby group — says the rule will bring consumers “one step closer to having a strong right to control their financial data”.\\nIn addition, the regulatory changes should bring the US closer to the wider vision of Open Finance: having your entire financial life — spanning your deposit account, pension, mortgage, insurance and share portfolio — instantly available in the one place, and easily portable to different providers. Benton notes that Australia started with this idea — an open data rule that would expand to cover everything.\\nBut steep barriers to fully Open Finance remain.\\nThe first is a “huge trust issue” between the traditional banks and the third parties, says Jones. One unanswered question is who is liable in the event of fraud or the loss of data. What is needed, says Jones, is either clear legislation or a “killer app”.\\nIn a recent Omdia survey on open banking, the top priorities of the banks were online security and protecting against fraud.\\nPitts agrees that the question of trust is key. “When I think about a bank, the image for me is a vault — and the vault conveys trust in a deeply meaningful way,” he says. “I think you need that same level of trust in open banking, and that means appropriate regulation and policies and procedures when it comes to fraud and privacy.”', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/e0203daa-1eca-46fd-a122-f6b4e5e29ec2', 'title': 'America embraces Open Banking', 'publication_time': '2023-11-07T05:30:12.112Z'}, uuid=UUID('4853cf96-ba50-48ec-89b2-6a81b2b3c665'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nAntoine Gara in New York\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nThe quick ascent of short-term interest rates since 2022, amid high inflation and resilient economic growth, has put borrowing costs in developed markets at multi-decade highs. This has put pressure on the balance sheets of a broad array of leveraged companies that have borrowed heavily using variable-rate debt.\\nThe number of companies exposed to rising borrowing costs has grown over the past two decades as more corporate borrowers have turned to the loan market to raise floating-rate debt — rather than issuing bonds that would fix their borrowing costs for years, or decades.\\nThis trend has accompanied the rise in private equity-owned companies, which tend to borrow from the broadly syndicated loan market and collateralised loan obligation (CLO) funds — or, increasingly, from private lenders such as Blackstone Group, Apollo Global, and Ares Management.\\nSince the global financial crisis, the size of the market for CLOs has grown almost fourfold: to nearly $1tn, according to Bank of America. It “has grown in step with the bank loan market and expanded at a quicker pace than other credit market sectors”, points out research from Guggenheim Investments. Analysts at Morgan Stanley predict that the private debt market will more than double in size by 2027, to $2.3tn globally.\\nThis rise in loan use has mostly come during an era of low interest rates, which has long since ended — creating challenges for many borrowers, particularly those carrying single B debt ratings or lower. These pressures are mitigated, however, by a loosening of creditor protections over the past decade, which has given companies more flexibility to operate through short-term economic challenges.\\nBut those loosening covenants have also allowed many borrowers to avoid buying hedges to insure their floating-rate debts against rising rates — a decision that may now prove costly.\\n“People went into this interest rate rise unhedged — and hedging is expensive,” says Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire. “Ultimately, some companies are going to have a difficult time.”\\n“People went into this interest rate rise unhedged\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009some companies are going to have a difficult time\\nThe rise in interest costs has hit most sponsor-backed companies, but has had the greatest impact on lower-quality borrowers by eating away at the cash flows they use to service debts.\\nMoody’s analysts have warned that, by the end of this year, more than half of single B minus rated US companies will not be generating enough cash to cover their capital expenditure while servicing their debt. That means those businesses will be forced to dip into their cash reserves to cover their spending.\\nThe interest coverage ratio for these companies — the extent to which operating earnings cover interest payments — could reach 0.91 by December, from 1.32 at the end of 2022, according to Moody’s, and could fall further still. A figure below 1 indicates that earnings are not sufficient to cover interest costs.\\n“Once your capital structure is cash flow break-even, it becomes very vulnerable to any reductions in earnings from the business,” says Chaney Sheffield, an investment partner at credit investment group Canyon Partners. “Rates matter a lot and many capital structures that were conceived with SOFR [the floating interest rate benchmark] near zero are significantly stressed.”\\nThis is expected to lead, eventually, to a rise in defaults after a wave of ratings downgrades were issued earlier in the year. Rating agency S&P Global has forecast that, by June 2024, corporate default rates in the US will rise to 4.5 per cent, up from 1.7 per cent at the start of 2023.\\nRecommended\\nResilient economic growth has alleviated some of the pressure on leveraged companies, by helping them to manage more expensive debt burdens and the impact of inflation on salaries and other inputs, such as raw material costs.\\nJohn Fekete, head of capital markets at Crescent Capital, an alternative investment group that manages $40bn in assets, says private equity-owned companies have generally outperformed expectations over the past year. He adds that the US Federal Reserve has had success in taming wage inflation, which is proving to be a new tailwind for profit margins.\\nFekete acknowledges that a wall of forthcoming debt maturities will prove expensive for many borrowers, who are likely to see their overall financing costs rise. But he says most companies should be able to refinance their debts.\\nThe bigger question of ‘higher for longer’ isn’t necessarily about today, it is whether the overall rise in interest rates will slow the economy down\\nRoughly 10 per cent of the loan market faces refinancings in 2025 and a further 16 per cent the following year. However, the vast majority are single B rated or double B rated borrowers, who should have access to capital. Lower-rated companies, however, may struggle with refinancing. Companies rated single B and below have about $1.1tn maturing between 2024 and 2028.\\nAnd, while most investors and analysts believe the interest rate shock has largely passed, a slowdown in the economy could present new challenges.\\n“The bigger question of ‘higher for longer’ isn’t necessarily about today, it is whether the overall rise in interest rates will slow the economy down,” says Fekete. “When the economy slows and we are in a higher rate environment, that’s when we will see a real rise in defaults.”', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/ed1d02ed-557e-4613-8115-884876d76233', 'title': 'Floating-rate exposure set to cause more balance-sheet pain', 'publication_time': '2023-11-06T05:00:58.390Z'}, uuid=UUID('6745b1c2-e73f-4846-ae4c-f8f8f8d489d6'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nTim Harford\\nOne of the modern classics of economics is an article from 2006 with the self-explanatory title “Paying Not to Go to the Gym”, in which researchers Stefano DellaVigna and Ulrike Malmendier studied the behaviour of nearly 8,000 gym members and found it “difficult to reconcile with standard preferences and beliefs”.\\nBy that, they meant that gym members seemed to be delusional, weak-willed or both. People on a monthly contract paid more per visit than those who simply showed up and paid at the door, suggesting they either had a very basic problem with arithmetic or, more likely, optimistic expectations about how often they would exercise. People on the rolling monthly contract also tended to let more than two months elapse between the last visit and the moment they got round to cancelling their\\xa0membership.\\nFor nerds like me, the article has an important message about the field of behavioural economics . We’ll get to that. There’s also a broader question. The subscription business model has expanded from traditional products, such as newspapers and gym memberships to software, streaming media, vegetable boxes, shaving kits, makeup, clothes and support for creative types via Patreon or Substack. We should all be asking ourselves, if so many people are paying not to go to the gym, what else are we paying not to do?\\nA new working paper from economists Liran Einav, Benjamin Klopack and Neale Mahoney attempts an answer. Using data from a credit and debit card provider, they examine what happens to subscriptions for 10 popular services when the card that is paying for them is replaced. At this moment, the service provider suddenly stops getting paid and must contact the customer to ask for updated payment details.\\nYou can guess what happens next: for many people, this request reminds them of a subscription they had stopped thinking about and immediately prompts them to cancel it. Relative to a typical month, cancellation rates soar in months when a payment card is replaced — from 2 per cent to at least 8 per cent. Einav and his colleagues use this data to estimate how easily many people let stale subscriptions continue. Relative to a benchmark in which infallible subscribers instantly cancel once they decide they are no longer getting enough value, the researchers predict that subscribers will take many extra months — on average 20 — to get around to cancelling.\\nDon’t take the precise numbers too seriously — as with most social science, this is not a rigorously controlled experiment but an attempt to tease meaning out of noisy real-world data. What you should take seriously is the likelihood that you are swimming in barely noticed subscriptions, some of which you would choose to cancel if you were forced to pay attention to them for a few minutes. Perhaps you should. Come to think of it, perhaps I should.\\nBut I promised a geeky lesson about behavioural economics too. Loyal readers will have noted some recent scandals in behavioural science: experiments conducted separately by two well-known researchers, Dan Ariely and Francesca Gino, have been found (in the opinion of independent experts) to contain manipulated or fraudulent data. Both deny wrongdoing.\\nIn the light of this dismaying situation, it would be understandable if people lost a bit of confidence in the field of behavioural economics. So it is worth reminding ourselves of what behavioural economics is trying to achieve. The field has long aimed to bring some psychological realism to economics, whose traditional textbook model has no room for people who take out a gym membership, fail to go to the gym and then neglect to cancel the gym subscription.\\nIts founding member is the co-author of Nudge , Nobel memorial prize winner Richard Thaler . Thaler’s project has always been not to argue that the textbook model is contradicted by laboratory experiments, but that it is contradicted by the way that important markets work in the real\\xa0world.\\nIt is certainly reasonable to ask how many experiments in social psychology may have been fraudulently manipulated. Less outrageous, but of more practical significance, is the possibility that many experiments in social psychology are poorly reported and analysed. As I’ve argued recently, we need to strengthen the foundations of scientific practice to prevent this.\\nEconomists can certainly learn from experiments, but contact with reality should be an important part of economics, which is — or should be — a practical subject.\\nRecommended\\nWhether we are sticking closely to the old textbook model or embracing the latest ideas from behavioural science, our concepts should be taken more seriously when they explain what we see around us every day.\\nIf people really are lazy, short-sighted and inattentive, as behavioural economics suggests, then subscriptions are a hugely attractive business model. The subscriptification of everything suggests that businesses have noticed this.\\nThere are some whimsical ideas in behavioural science, and some of them will not stand the test of time. But the central proposition of Nudge is not whimsical: it’s that the default position matters far more than you’d think, not in a laboratory experiment but in markets where billions or trillions are at stake.\\nPeople delegate life-changingly huge decisions — for example, about contributions to their pensions — to the path of least resistance. If behavioural public policy means anything, it means shaping those default positions for the public good. It’s an idea to which I still subscribe.\\nTim Harford’s new book for children, “The Truth Detective” (Wren & Rook), is now available\\nFollow @FTMag to find out about our latest stories first', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/b2622d99-4eaf-44f7-bbe2-4b61c716a06b', 'title': 'Netflix and bill — the high price of a subscription lifestyle', 'publication_time': '2023-10-06T04:00:27.860Z'}, uuid=UUID('8599a2cb-d3a5-4b75-9ec9-58ce3601ce22'), db_id=''),\n",

The pilot is only in a single market for now.\\nSnapchat and X, formerly Twitter, also sell optional subscriptions offering paying users exclusive features, such as verified profiles, custom app themes and fewer ads. Last month Elon Musk, owner of X, said he was considering introducing a “small monthly payment” for all users of the app, as a way to “combat vast armies of bots” that can post freely on the platform.\\nMeta’s changes may take place in coming weeks, the people with knowledge of its plans said. The Silicon Valley-based company has until the end of November to comply with a Luxembourg court ruling from this year that found that Facebook “cannot justify” the use of personal data to target consumers with ads unless it gains their consent. The court said companies should explore a subscription model in its ruling.\\nMeanwhile, Meta is engaging with European regulators ahead of the deadline to ensure its approach passes muster.\\nUnder the plans, which have been discussed with regulators in Brussels and Ireland, Meta would offer an ad-free version of Instagram and Facebook for those willing to pay, or a free version for those who consent to be targeted by ads based on their personal information, these people said.\\n“Fundamental rights cannot be for sale,” Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy activist, said in response to the plans. “Are we going to pay for the right to vote or the right to free speech next?

But the presence of so many employee details on underground forums underlines the risk that large corporations like MGM face from the varied and constantly evolving methods that hackers use to gain access to networks.\\n“For such large and profitable companies like MGM and Caesars, they would have had the resources available to protect their data and customers,” said Andrew Martin, chief executive at Dynarisk. “They could have done things to prevent this breach that were relatively simple, including if they had been monitoring for these credentials being stolen and acted [promptly], the whole thing could have been prevented.”\\nThe login and passwords in the data set were probably stolen from a computer infected with a malware called Redline , according to Dynarisk, which hides behind pirated copies of video games or other software. The MGM IT employee’s password for his company login was “K@sper99!” and a Caesars IT employee’s was “W@lmart1”.\\nRedline also steals and packages freshly stolen cookies, the tiny pieces of information that browsers use to identify frequent visitors to websites so that users do not have to enter their login details repeatedly.\\nA person claiming to represent a hacking group nicknamed Scattered Spider told the Financial Times on Thursday that it had carried out the breach at MGM, including trying to tamper with the casino resort’s slot machines.\\nThe group is allegedly behind at least 100 attacks on major US corporations and is considered a major threat to western companies.\\nIts members, mostly English-speaking hackers from the US and Europe, are known to impersonate an employee they have studied over social media in phone calls to company help desks where they try to generate fresh passwords.\\nIn this instance, the person claiming to represent Scattered Spider said it had also compromised an employee’s phone number, allowing it to reroute a text message containing a one time password to the hackers, instead of the employee.\\nThe stolen passwords and logins were for a system called Okta, made by the eponymous identity management company based in San Francisco, whose software is used by thousands of businesses to verify their employees’ identity before granting access to internal company websites.\\nA dark web site tied to a group that Scattered Spider has sometimes worked with said on Friday that “MGM made the hasty decision to shut down each and every one of their Okta servers after learning we had been lurking on their Okta servers”.\\n“Although we cannot speak to the MGM event, we have seen social engineering attacks involving a threat actor calling an organisation’s help desk, impersonating an employee, and persuading the help desk to reset multi-factor authentication for a highly privileged account,” said a spokesperson for Okta, referring to the accounts of either senior employees at companies, or people working in the IT departments whose accounts would have greater access to the rest of the companies’ networks.\\nDynarisk’s Martin said more companies were at risk — other data sets he had seen traded recently included credentials for employees at more than 500 other companies, including those at Wells Fargo, WPP, Experian, Diageo, Wayfair, Epic Games and Adobe.\\n“More of these hacks are coming,” he said.', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/3428d3b3-7283-4650-bd5d-2120b52f70cd', 'title': 'MGM and Caesars employees’ logins ‘hacked and traded’ on cybercriminal forums', 'publication_time': '2023-09-15T12:21:31.983Z'}, uuid=UUID('397a60a0-7000-4206-8c1b-05a96b2c6512'), db_id=''),\n",

Here’s an article by Alphaville writer Bryce Elder on that.\\nFrom the company’s perspective, subscriptions help them reap steady revenues, rather than having spikes in sales grouped around major product launches. The argument for customers is that subscribing to a service that includes updates is cheaper than paying a large upfront cost every time your software of choice receives a major update. For goods subscriptions, it’s because shopping is difficult and annoying.\\nBut businesses aren’t your friends, so there’s the natural suspicion that subscriptions — by being hard to efficiently monitor and manage — are ultimately costing subscribers more. That dynamic is the subject of a new NBER paper by Liran Einav and Neale Mahoney of Stanford University, and Benjamin Klopack of Texas A&M. They write:\\nRetailers are increasingly selling goods and services via subscriptions instead of spot markets. In this paper, we study one benefit to the retailer of selling subscriptions: the possibility that — presumably because of inattention or inertia — consumers continue to pay for subscriptions after the flow benefit falls below its price.\\nThe authors have used data from a “large” but unspecified US payment card network to monitor this, focusing on cards that have been have been replaced for some reason (they give expiration as an example) — which forces card users to decide whether they want to maintain their current subscriptions, effectively forcing the questions of inattention and inertia:\\nReplaced cards require an active subscription renewal decision, and we document that months during which cards are replaced are associated with much higher rates of cancellation for the ten subscriptions we study. We write down and estimate a stylized model of subscription renewals that allows us to recover the baseline degree of inattention\\nAfter some application of those fancy-looking letters that economists are so fond of:\\nWe find that seller revenues (or equivalently average subscription durations) are significantly higher due to subscriber inattention, with important heterogeneity across services. We estimate that inattention increases firm revenues by between 14% and more than 200%, depending on the service.\\nOne interesting finding is that benefit of subscriber attention (from the subscriber’s perspective at least) varies greatly by service.\\nThe paper models this in part through a hypothetical regulated system where subscribers are made to actively choose to continue their subscriptions at regular intervals. This table shows how the revenue ratio impact would change based on these increments (where ∞ is automatic renewal):\\nThe authors find the effects “are substantial, yet highly heterogeneous”. In one of the example services studied, inattention is seemingly integral. Alphaville’s emphasis below:\\nInattention (relative to “perfect” attention) modestly increases revenues for some services (eg, 14% for service G), but triples revenues for others (service B). 23 In other words, the average subscription duration for service B would drop from its observed duration of over a year to about 4 months if subscribers were fully attentive. It is plausible to suspect that this subscription service would not be viable from a business perspective if not for its subscribers’ inattention.\\nThey note, however, that manual re-subscription could well be seen as a “potentially undesirable remedy”, which is academy speak for “it would be massively bloody annoying”. Indeed, automatic renewal is often a desirable feature.\\nWhat does it mean? Subscriptions are already under scrutiny, particularly as the Federal Trade Commission takes Amazon to court over allegations the ecommerce megalodon manipulated customers into subscribing to Amazon Prime .\\nEvidence that they are they (in)actively cost customers extra money might make them a popular target for the US’s happy-warrior regulators, but the balance between cost and convenience is very delicate.

In the US, Netflix has told customers that if they want to share their password, they must pay $7.99 a month to add a person outside their home, or $6.99 if they are prepared to have an account with adverts.\\nThat policy appears to be working. In the three months to the end of June, Netflix added 5.9mn subscribers, well above Wall Street expectations for 2mn. “The cancel reaction was low,” the company told investors on Wednesday.\\nHowever, shares in Netflix, which had gained more than 8 per cent in the five days leading up to the earnings release, dropped more than 8 per cent in post-market trading after the company reported softer revenue.\\nNetflix’s quarterly revenue rose to $8.2bn, up 3 per cent from a year ago but just short of forecasts for $8.3bn. The company predicted that revenue would climb to $8.5bn in the current quarter, missing analysts’ forecasts for $8.7bn.\\nNetflix’s password crackdown reflects the harsh realities of the costly streaming model that it has pioneered. When Wall Street was more keen on streaming, investors looked past the heavy losses companies were enduring, so long as they were able to keep adding subscribers quickly.\\nBut as the wider market has cooled, investors are more focused on profits. Competition has heated up, with Disney and others vying with Netflix for customers.\\nRecommended\\nNetflix is profitable, while Disney+, Paramount+ and other rival streaming services are still losing money. Netflix on Wednesday reported quarterly net income of $1.5bn, up 3 per cent from the same period a year ago.\\nThe company said it would spend less money this year due to the historic labour strike in Hollywood, which has brought movie and television production in the US to a halt. Netflix now expects free cash flow of $5bn this year, up from its previous estimate of $3.5bn.\\nMany workers have blamed Netflix for ushering in a streaming revolution that has made it difficult for screenwriters to make a decent living. On an earnings call, co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said the strike was “not an outcome that we wanted”, while highlighting his father’s ties to unions.\\n“On a personal level, I was raised in a union household.

Netflix “needs to consider its pricing strategy for the mid to long term”, he said.\\nAfter tumbling last year, Netflix shares have made a comeback in 2023, gaining more than 60 per cent.\\n“While we’ve made steady progress this year, we have more work to do to reaccelerate our growth,” Netflix told shareholders in a letter.', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/fda9fa7b-3a4c-4a16-b384-7867b0974074', 'title': 'Netflix’s password-sharing crackdown pays off with nearly 6mn new subscribers', 'publication_time': '2023-07-19T21:37:20.999Z'}, uuid=UUID('d876845c-4ebe-4f50-b4b4-27d5fe4ab9d1'), db_id=''),\n",

The company reported $13.5bn in revenue, over $2bn more than the consensus expected and double the year-ago number. It’s targets for next quarter were equally impressive. The stock rose 6.6 per cent in late trading. We’ve compared Nvidia in 2023 to Cisco in 2000 — but back then Cisco was only growing about half as fast. Should we relinquish our scepticism? Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and ethan.wu@ft.com .\\nWe have written a series of newsletters about private credit and whether it can deliver on the promise of equity-like returns without equity-like risk.\\nTalking to people across the industry — direct lenders, managers of business development corporations, and so on — one idea that keeps coming up is that private credit investors are protected by large equity buffers at the company level and by low leverage at the fund level. Lenders into leveraged buyout deals are insulated from losses by the increasingly large equity investments of the PE deal sponsors. And private credit vehicles themselves often contain a big slug of equity. BDCs, for example, generally have debt/equity ratios of just 1 or 1.5. This means credit losses do not have as much potential for destroying value as in more leveraged vehicles (such as banks!).\\nThe basic idea is that there can be a lot of losses before creditors get badly hurt. There is a good deal of truth in this. But it is important to be clear about exactly which creditors are protected, how, and to what degree.\\nHere is Michael Arougheti, chief executive of Ares, back in May (as flagged by Robin Wigglesworth over at Alphaville ):\\nThe big misunderstanding [is that in] the bulk of the private credit markets\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009[loans] are underpinned by cash equity from a sophisticated institutional equity owner and a sophisticated management team, and we are going into this current cycle with more equity subordination in all of these capital structures with better underwriting than we’ve ever seen\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\nThe math would simply tell you that if we’re talking about real losses in the private credit asset class, you will have blown through $2tn to $3tn of institutional equity, but people don’t like to talk about that fact.\\nAlong remarkably similar lines, one executive at a big BDC put this to us:\\nYou cannot run math resulting in a creditor losing a dollar. You’d need a 40 per cent default rate and 40 cent [on the dollar] recoveries to blow through 50 per cent of the capital structure. I understand the point that private credit hasn’t been tested, but [historically normal] 10 per cent default rates and 70 cent recoveries still wouldn’t result in half of the equity getting evaporated.\\nWhat constitutes “real losses”, though? If all the equity has been lost, the company is worth less than the loans against it, and the lenders lose some of their capital. In that specific sense, a bigger equity cheque from the sponsor, and therefore a lower loan-to-value ratio, is indeed a help. And the sponsor cheques have been getting bigger. Buyout loan-to-value ratios have been falling in recent years. Here, from Ares , is what LTVs looked like before the financial crisis and the pandemic:\\nNow, as banks pull back from the syndicated loan market and financing conditions tighten, private credit lenders are able to extract even bigger equity cheques, and lower LTVs. A representative LTV these days looks more like 40 per cent, several people told us.\\nHowever, a company remaining more valuable than its debt does not imply that the debt investors’ investment has retained all its value. Imagine a company that was once worth $100mn, with $50mn in debt (a 50 per cent LTV ratio). If the company is now worth less than $50mn, it is likely facing serious cash flow problems, and is struggling or failing to make its debt payments. What’s more, the lenders are facing the prospect of owning the company, a huge, time-consuming, expensive pain in the ass. They may not be able to realise all of that $50mn by the time the company is sold.\\nRemember, in this connection, that equity layers are not money in the company’s or fund’s bank account. “The equity doesn’t pay debt service. It’s theoretical, not a pile of money there to be resourced,” as Christina Padgett, head of leveraged finance research at Moody’s, puts it. Once the equity is gone, the promise of high-single-digit creditor returns is probably long gone, too.\\nThe big equity cheque from deal sponsors does, on the other hand, signal the depth of those sponsors’ commitment. If a company is struggling with cash flow, its sponsors may provide financing or stump up more equity as part of a refinancing — as they did in the recent case of the fintech company Finastra.\\nBut this is a hope, not a guarantee, and there are misalignments between PE and PC. One senior direct lender notes that while a top PE shop can afford to take heavy losses on, say, a quarter of its portfolio, private credit’s returns are much more dependent on preventing losses. “PE equity cheques don’t keep you safe if you haven’t done good underwriting on your own,” he says.\\nTo get a sense of what full-cycle private credit losses might look like, Padgett and her team look at the history of “distressed exchanges”. These are voluntary debt restructurings to avoid bankruptcy, often by PE-sponsored companies with floating-rate debt (and thus resembling what many direct lenders invest in). Between 1987 and 2019, the average creditor in a distressed exchange recovered a respectable 72 cents on the dollar. But two in five distressed exchanges did not ultimately stop a bankruptcy. In those cases, recovery rates looked much worse; the average creditor lost half of what they put in, with some losing more.\\nThe point is that blowing through half a company’s value in a distress situation is not just possible, it’s relatively common. Just this year, a change to medical billing laws wiped out KKR’s $3.5bn equity investment in bankrupt Envision Healthcare. Senior creditors will probably take losses.\\nZooming out, a lot of people in the private credit industry have told us that the asset class can offer high single- to low-double-digit returns, while offering a risk profile as good as or better than that available in the high-yield bond market. That is to say, the promise is equity-like returns without equity-like risk. The promise rests on two foundations: extra spread on the returns side, and high equity buffers on the risk side.\\nThe extra spread, the industry argues, comes from providing borrowers with certainty, privacy and flexibility that public bond markets cannot. Sceptics argue the spread just comes from taking extra credit risk. We disagree with the sceptics, but expect this spread to diminish over time as more and more capital rushes into the industry. The equity buffer, meanwhile, will indeed help lenders avert wipeout losses. But they will not stop a real credit cycle from eroding the high returns that private credit has enjoyed in recent years. Equity returns without equity risk is a violation of the laws of financial gravity, which come for all asset classes eventually.

The result was a 5.9mn bump in subscriber numbers in this year’s second quarter that was hailed as a show of strength by some analysts. But this is only a temporary fix.\\nLike ride-sharing company Uber, Netflix priced its streaming service at low rates to attract the biggest audience possible. Like Uber, it was then bombarded by rivals willing to spend large sums to compete. Six years ago, Netflix claimed that its only real competition was sleep. Now it includes comparisons to streaming competitors in its shareholder letter.\\nAs its shareholders grow weary of subsidising online services, prices are rising. NBCUniversal’s Peacock just lifted its cheapest monthly rate by $1 and Disney+’s US revenue per subscriber has picked up by 20 per cent in the past year.\\nThis means Netflix’s increases do not stand out. It is still the sector leader with nearly 239mn subscribers and expects another increase this quarter. But Netflix must spend more on marketing to draw in those subscribers.\\nLower costs are temporary too. In a repeat of the shutdowns that occurred during Covid-19 lockdowns, the Hollywood writers’ strike has stopped production of films and TV shows. That means Netflix will spend less on content. Free cash flow is expected to be at least $5bn this year, up from $1.6bn in 2022. Long-term debt has come down as well to $14.1bn from $14.9bn two years ago. One can sense that the focus is on level-headed financial decisions just by the near total lack of chatter about video games — an expensive endeavour that Netflix is also involved in.\\nBut when all of the users who were sharing passwords pay up or leave, Netflix will have to find new sources of revenue growth. Advertising subscriptions are not yet large enough for Netflix to choose to put a number on them. It is also a crowded field. Everyone, from YouTube to Uber, now tries to attract ad dollars.\\nIf Netflix wants to keep its focus on tweaking payments it could remove monthly subscriptions altogether and reduce churn by offering only annual or 18-month plans. Month-by-month payments were once a way to distinguish streaming from cable TV. That differentiation is no longer necessary.\\nListen to Lex deputy editor Elaine Moore talk to creators, companies and critics about the next era of social media in the FT’s new Tech Tonic podcast series .', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/6c76b102-d012-4abd-96d7-54124f7235ef', 'title': 'Netflix: password sharing cutback provides shortlived gain', 'publication_time': '2023-07-20T10:36:06.458Z'}, uuid=UUID('9aaf2439-3c71-41f7-b43c-36c688f5ad86'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nMarc Filippino, Katie Martin and Christopher Miller\\nThis is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘Signs of a UK inflation cool-down’\\nMarc Filippino Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Thursday, July 20th, and this is your FT News Briefing.\\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\\nUkraine’s armed forces are having a hard time with Russian mines, and Sunday’s election could prove pretty tough for the prime minister of Spain. Plus, it looks like the UK is finally getting some relief from high inflation. But the Bank of England isn’t quite out of the woods yet.\\nKatie Martin So let’s not assume that one positive number, one bit of good news, is the start of something bigger. Let’s be a little bit more patient than we might have been in the past.\\nMarc Filippino I’m Marc Filippino, and here’s the news you need to start your day.\\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\\nNetflix added 6mn new subscribers last quarter, more than double what analysts expected. The streaming service released its second-quarter earnings yesterday, and it said that its crackdown on password sharing contributed to subscriber growth. It basically told customers, “If you want to share a password, then you need to fork over an extra eight bucks a month to add a person outside their home” — and it worked. Revenue rose last quarter, but it came up short of forecasts. Netflix shares dropped nearly 8 per cent after the bell on Wednesday.\\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\\nUK inflation for June fell more than expected. It fell to 7.9 per cent, nearly a full per cent lower than May. And oh boy, did investors like that. Here to talk about the celebrations, the FT’s markets editor Katie Martin. Hi, Katie.\\nKatie Martin Hey, how you doing?\\nMarc Filippino I’m doing well, but probably not as good as you guys. I mean, UK inflation had a 15-month low in June. I mean, is there dancing in the street? Is there a party in the office? What’s going on?\\nKatie Martin We have got some cake in the newsroom, but it’s not because of the inflation numbers. Yeah, it’s a very nice number. And I think, you know, certain investors have got themselves into a little bit of a doom loop.\\nMarc Filippino How so?\\nKatie Martin You know, not without reason, but thinking inflation is just so much higher than in the rest of the developed world. And the UK does have certain pressures that other countries don’t have. And how on earth are we going to get this number to come down? And now, you know, it’s never worth reading too much into one number, but the market is definitely happy about the number, 7.9 per cent in June. Last time around it was 8.7 and the market had been expecting 8.2. So it’s an even better number than people had hoped for. So that’s why we have seen, you know, a decent market reaction.\\nMarc Filippino Now, we should note that core inflation only fell slightly. Core inflation being the cost of things that aren’t volatile, stuff like food and energy. But that being said, do investors see this as a turning point?\\nKatie Martin Potentially. As I say, I don’t want to get overly excited about just one number. But if you look at the UK government bond market, the reaction there definitely tells you that investors think, “Mmm, is it possible we’ve seen the peak here?” So you look at the yields on 10-year gilts and on two-year gilts, they’ve come down substantially. And that tells you the prices have gone up, which in turn tells you that people think there’s a chance that the Bank of England might not need to be quite so aggressive with interest rate rises as it previously was. So the markets backed away a little bit from the view that the next rise in interest rates might be half a percentage point. Now sees it as somewhat more likely that it will be a quarter of a percentage point. This is the market’s way of saying, “Look, let’s cross our fingers and pinch our noses and hope that maybe, you know, the worst is behind us”. You know, the great British stagflation panic kind of might be over.\\nMarc Filippino So Katie, what you’re saying is that, if I got this right, this is an optimistic drop. Nearly a full per cent. Still very high. And it’s\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009overall, I guess if we have to take a snapshot, it’s overall good news for different parts of the market.\\nKatie Martin Yes, exactly. So different parts of the UK stock market have reacted quite well to this. Partly that’s because sterling has fallen. So a massive chunk of all the revenues that flow into companies that are in the FTSE 100 come from overseas and in foreign currencies. So a weaker sterling is, you know, flatters those results. But in addition, property groups have done very well off the back of this. You know, buyers or potential buyers of properties have been really spooked by what’s been happening with mortgage rates recently. They’ve just been rocketing higher. So this kind of dose of relief that maybe they’re not going to get quite as high as we’ve feared has been good for shares in housebuilders like Persimmon, Barratt, Taylor Wimpey and they make up a decent proportion of the UK stock market. So all in all it’s definitely good news. It’s just that the analysts and investors that we speak to are saying, “You know, let’s keep our cool.”\\nMarc Filippino Katie Martin is the FT’s markets editor. Thank you, Katie.\\nKatie Martin Pleasure.\\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\\nMarc Filippino Ukraine admitted recently that its counteroffensive wasn’t making the progress it initially hoped for. A big reason for that: Russian forces had time to put down extensive minefields, and that’s making it hard for Ukrainian forces to make a breakthrough. Chris Miller just got back from visiting Ukrainian troops on the front line, and he joins me now. Hi, Chris.\\nChristopher Miller Hi, Marc.\\nMarc Filippino So, Chris, what was the morale like in the places that you visited?\\nChristopher Miller Ahead of the counteroffensive, morale was high. Their expectations were that they would be able to wrest back a significant portion of a Russian-occupied territory. They have not been able to break through these really dense Russian defences along the front line. In fact, they’re taking a lot of casualties. So morale has been zapped a little bit here. I spoke with a guy named\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009a soldier named Sultan. He was telling me, as he was recovering from a concussion that he suffered from a mine blast, that a lot of his guys were exhausted and they were tired. They were doing what he described as these dismounted operations that were really slow. And they didn’t have any great plan to how they were going to make progress other than inching forward metre by metre in these really dense minefields.\\nMarc Filippino So what do they do then? Is there some way to circumvent the mines or attack Russian forces in a different way?\\nChristopher Miller You know, they really just have to take it head on. They are using some of their longer range artillery and trying to soften up Russian positions and sort of dislodge them to make it easier for them to, when they get to these front lines, not have to deal with a lot of the anti-tank weaponry that they’re being faced with in these wide open spans of Ukraine south. But really, you know, to move forward, you’ve got to take one step ahead. And these guys are having to do it in these dense minefields.\\nMarc Filippino Chris, what are the factors that can actually make a difference for Ukraine in the near future then?\\nChristopher Miller What could really make a difference for Ukrainian soldiers is more western artillery. Artillery is key to softening those Russian lines and helping really to distract Russian soldiers from these Ukrainian engineers and minesweepers and infantry that are forced to move so slowly forward towards Russian lines. They would love to have long-range missiles and these would help to hit Russian logistical centres, even things\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009key infrastructure like the Crimea bridge, for example, which is key to Russia resupplying its forces in the south. And certainly the Ukrainians would like F-16 jets. But we know that this is probably something that’s a long ways off. But the Ukrainians say those really would help in these complex combined forces operations that they’re being forced to undertake right now on the southern and eastern front lines.\\nMarc Filippino Chris Miller is the FT’s Ukraine correspondent. He’s based in Kyiv. Thanks, Chris.\\nChristopher Miller Thank you.\\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\\nMarc Filippino Spain is facing a pivotal vote on Sunday. Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister, called the snap election after his centre-left Socialist party had a miserable showing during May’s regional election. And if polls are correct, he’s headed for a defeat on Sunday. One of the main reasons for his party’s loss of popularity is his decision to enter a coalition with the leftwing separatist Bildu party, which has never apologised for years of terrorism.\\nPablo Simon The situation have improved a lot. The memory of the terrorism and what happened, even so, it is still affecting the mobilisation of the right.\\nMarc Filippino That’s Pablo Simon, a political scientist in Madrid and one of Spain’s leading political analysts.\\nPablo Simon Because in general, everything that is related with the territorial conflict, with the terrorism and so on tends to divide the left, and for the right, it’s something that mobilise them a lot because they consider that the pro-independence party want to destroy Spain and in specific they’re still having the same memory and the same will of their former terrorist of Eta.\\nMarc Filippino Simon says the centre-right People’s party looks set to win on Sunday under its new leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo.\\nPablo Simon Núñez Feijóo we can say that he’s a traditional conservative leader in the terms of economic and more pro-business agenda. He will plan, as the Popular party always do, a kind of redaction in taxation. So in general, more liberal agenda. But in terms of social rights, I would say that he’s, to some extent, moderate.\\nMarc Filippino That was Spanish political scientist Pablo Simon.

Although CBDC would be a liability of the central bank, it doesn’t follow that the central bank would have access to user data. Under an intermediated model, for example, customers would hold accounts or wallets managed by private providers, with data protection in line with existing banking solutions or better.\\nSecond, central banks should examine novel technology solutions to allow CBDC users to enjoy as much “cash-like” privacy as possible. The public should have absolute confidence that their data is confidential. Technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs and secure enclaves can technically enforce privacy while protecting system integrity.\\nFinally, the central bank must first and foremost embrace its responsibility to service citizens in its design of CBDC. It is not beholden to shareholders but to us, the people. This is an opportunity for a best-in-class solution that sets the standard for all payment offerings for years to come.\\nThe ability to hold cash and spend it without authorisation is an important source of personal privacy, so it’s entirely natural for people to be wary of new technologies digitising this type of money. Open collaboration between central banks, regulators and technology providers across both the public and private sectors will be key in fostering the necessary consumer trust to make this transition credible.\\nJack Fletcher Head of Policy and Government Relations for Digital Currencies, R3 London EC2Y, UK', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/e6c02398-78ce-44c8-990a-3eeb95d53b64', 'title': 'Letter: Central banks should ease fears over CBDC privacy', 'publication_time': '2023-07-27T23:00:31.245Z'}, uuid=UUID('11e46ca2-753d-47be-b56a-0623e4e5ac2f'), db_id=''),\n",

McKenzie said that while the FSB supported an earlier version of the government’s proposals to make it easier to cancel subscriptions, the Bill went “far beyond the approach consulted on” last year.\\nMeanwhile Sky, responding to MPs examining the bill, said it had “serious concerns” over the plans for subscriptions. The company acknowledged that some industry practices “cause consumer harm” but said the bill’s provisions were “too prescriptive and broadly drawn”.\\nThey “will add significant costs on to businesses — and by extension consumers — for marginal consumer gains”, Sky said, describing the plans as “poor policymaking”. It said that it does not “engage in practices that roll our customers over into long-term contracts that they cannot get out of”.\\nAccording to a government impact assessment published in April, the changes would result in one-off costs of £315mn to businesses. They would also face costs of £1.2bn through lost revenue and £1.7bn for giving customers reminders and extra cancellation methods, it estimated.\\nOwen Meredith, chief executive of News Media Association, which represents the UK’s newspaper industry, also said the bill’s provisions “could undermine publishers’ efforts to build a truly sustainable future for journalism if left unchecked”.\\nHe added that the legislation risked “creating information fatigue” and increasing costs to households.\\nHowever, Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at consumer group Which?, said the proposals would help people end contracts in a more cost-effective and timely manner.\\nCurbing “subscription traps” would give customers “more confidence to pay for products and services because they know they will be able to more easily exit contracts”, she said.\\nIn a statement, the FSB said the bill’s measures were “a good example of excessive regulatory zeal” and that “the original proposals were the right approach”.\\nThe business department said: “Consumers spend around £1.6bn a year on unwanted subscriptions.\\xa0The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill will ensure consumers are protected from subscription traps while also ensuring businesses are not overburdened by regulatory barriers.”', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/8cc19f43-2b24-4ff7-bf57-d3fa4bba585b', 'title': 'UK plans to ease cancelling subscriptions come under fire', 'publication_time': '2023-07-07T16:21:01.408Z'}, uuid=UUID('655f3302-82e1-460c-8b0d-4e8231a7f654'), db_id=''),\n",

Both stories address the broader context of subscription services and how companies are responding to consumer behavior related to managing subscriptions—whether by easing cancellations or adjusting sharing policies.

       "  (Document(text='\\nChristopher Grimes\\nWhen Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings declared in 2016\\xa0“we love people sharing” accounts, the company had a commanding lead in the streaming business and four years of blistering growth ahead of it. No one had yet heard of Disney Plus or the streaming wars.\\nBut after the platform lost subscribers early last year, Hastings called time on this breezy attitude towards password sharing, which has given rise to an estimated 100mn Netflix freeloaders around the world.\\nIn recent days, the company has launched password crackdowns in the US, UK and more than 100 other countries. In the US, it has told customers that if they want to share their password, they must pay $7.99 a month to add a person outside their home, or $6.99 if they are prepared to have an account with adverts.\\nThe crackdown plus the new push into advertising reflect the tough realities of the streaming business model that Netflix pioneered. In the boom times, investors were willing to overlook eight- or nine-figure quarterly losses as long as subscription growth was strong. Now, however, new sign-ups have slowed and competition is intense. In the US, the average household has 5.5 streaming subscriptions, notes Jennifer Chan, global strategic director at research group Kantar.\\n“Overall household streaming penetration hasn’t changed very much since the end of Covid,” Chan said. “So the focus for streamers now is on retaining their current customer base and becoming the priority subscription so that consumers aren’t cancelling — and if they are, how do you win them back.”\\nInvestors meanwhile want to see a path to profitability, putting serious pressure on most of the major streaming services to slash costs and come up with new strategies to generate cash.\\nNetflix is profitable, but Disney Plus, Paramount Plus and NBCUniversal’s Peacock are still racking up hefty losses. Warner Bros Discovery, which aggressively cut costs after the companies were combined in a $40bn merger last year,\\xa0recently told investors it expected to turn a profit in its streaming business a full year ahead of schedule and that this part of the business made $50mn in profit in the most recent quarter.\\nLike Netflix, Warner has been making big changes to its streaming service. On Tuesday it\\xa0combined its HBO Max service — home of Succession , White Lotus and Game of Thrones — with Discovery Plus, which specialises in low-cost unscripted programming such as 90-Day Fiancé . The combined service was renamed Max, and the company hopes the broader offering will increase customer numbers and engagement.\\nDisney chief executive Bob Iger plans a similar move later this year by merging child-friendly Disney Plus and Hulu, which focuses on general entertainment aimed at adults, into one app. Iger said this would boost sales of Disney’s with-adverts subscription packages, another step towards reaching its goal of turning a profit in streaming next year. In the meantime he must also address investor worries about subscriber growth — the company’s streaming services have lost customers for the past two quarters.\\nNetflix may face similar problems of retaining customers as it cuts password sharing options. In early trials, Netflix said some users dumped the service, with as many as 1mn cancellations in Spain alone, according to Kantar. While many return — either adding new accounts or opting for the cheaper ad-supported version — there is still some risk, Chan says.\\n“If people are to cancel their subscription, they will be exposed to life without Netflix” and perhaps switch to other services, she said. “I think people will come back, but they may not regain their whole subscriber base.”', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a85f2d38-1889-4108-92af-525ed924b133', 'title': 'Netflix is taking a necessary risk in tackling its 100mn freeloaders', 'publication_time': '2023-05-26T04:00:49.086Z'}, uuid=UUID('425e61e2-9e3c-45f5-90f1-c0e944439c8b'), db_id=''),\n",

But the US Federal Trade Commission’s decision to sue Amazon for leading customers into unwanted Prime subscriptions is part of a broader push to stop companies from nudging users into digital deals. Regulators are growing more forceful in their actions against Big Tech following years of investigation.\\xa0But this case is not the main event.\\nTech companies are fixated on subscription pricing models, which offer predictable, recurring revenue streams. They appear on ride-hailing apps, food delivery sites and video calls. Amazon’s Prime began as a subscription service for free shipping. It has since expanded to video streaming, music and shopping discounts for $139 per year. The FTC accuses Amazon of confusing customers. Amazon says the process to sign up and cancel is clear and simple.\\nPrime is a popular product. Benefits can exceed prices paid. The $25bn-plus in revenue that subscriptions provide is equal to less than a third of Amazon’s worldwide shipping costs last year. That suggests spending heavily on Prime results in other benefits for the company. Amazon has said before that subscribers tend to order more online.\\nThe company is cagey about numbers. The last tally provided was in April 2021, when then-chief executive Jeff Bezos put the total at more than 200mn worldwide. Subscriber numbers jumped during the coronavirus pandemic, but are likely to have stalled since. Meanwhile, subscription rates have been lifted, up 17 per cent in the US last year.\\nIf Amazon really wanted to change subscriptions, one possibility might be to follow the lead of software companies and move into usage-based pricing — an option that gives users more flexibility. But it would be easier to simply tweak the sign-up and cancellation process.\\nThis is one of a number of FTC investigations into Amazon.

The shift has been particularly significant because banks have curtailed some of the lending they did before the financial crisis.\\nCLOs buy up hundreds of different loans, package them and use the interest payments they generate to fund new slices of debt, which are then sold on to banks, insurers and other investors.\\nBut they are governed by the rules for their so-called “reinvestment period”, during which CLOs can use the revenues they generate to invest in new debt. Once this period has lapsed, they have to use such monies to pay down their obligations.\\nBank of America strategist Pratik Gupta estimates that by the end of the year roughly 40 per cent of CLOs will exit their reinvestment periods, reducing the demand for new loans.\\nMany CLOs have also already hit their limits on the number they can buy of triple C loans — one of the lowest credit ratings the major agencies can assign.\\nAt the same time, some CLOs have become more concerned about the low-rated debt they already hold, largely because of the increase in interest rates and its impact on the wider economy.\\nThe US Federal Reserve last week kept its benchmark, or fed funds, interest rate between 5 and 5.25 per cent but chair Jay Powell signalled further hikes were to come.\\nHigher interest rates are expected to weigh on corporate profit margins, while a slowing economy is also hitting revenue growth. With rating agencies projecting an uptick in corporate defaults, managers of CLOs have shown some reluctance to buy particularly risky loans .\\n“The brunt of rising rates is starting to be felt now,” said John McClain, a portfolio manager with Brandywine.\\nThe failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March have also had knock-on effects.\\nBofA’s Gupta said that large banks, traditionally big buyers of CLOs, had already “really started stepping away” from the market after stress tests were completed last year.\\nHe added that after this year’s failures, banks were now “a bit more conservative in deciding how to allocate to their [securities] portfolio” because they anticipated higher capital charges.\\nSome investors said the market’s problems would lead to increased borrowing costs until demand for new CLOs picked up.\\nAs an alternative to tapping the CLO market, some companies are now selling fixed-rate debt in the form of high-yield bonds or opting for shorter-maturing loans.\\nHeartland partially paid down a loan set to mature in April 2025 after raising money in the bond market and obtaining new capital from its owners — asset manager KKR and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. But in return for extending the maturity of the remaining loan, it also had to increase the interest rate by as much as 1.25 percentage points.\\nHeartland, PG&E and Internet Brands did not respond to requests for comment.', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/b3d4291f-857c-46c5-96b8-e67933b6e7e8', 'title': 'Slowdown in junk-rated loan market hits US corporate borrowing plans', 'publication_time': '2023-06-20T20:00:42.685Z'}, uuid=UUID('a1890081-e1f7-4b04-a349-a06e0b8c315b'), db_id=''),\n",

Both come with generous tax breaks.\\nThe Treasury wants to simplify the schemes with a view to expanding their use among lower earners in particular.\\nMinisters see employee share ownership as a way for employers to motivate and retain staff, while helping workers save and aligning their interests with the company’s.\\nBoth Conservative and Labour politicians have historically favoured employee ownership — viewing it respectively as a route to a share-owning society, or a way for workers to share the wealth they create.\\nVictoria Atkins, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the schemes offered “a boost for business” by giving people an extra stake in what they did, and that making them easy to set up would support the government’s objective of growing the economy.\\nListed companies have made relatively liberal use of a separate scheme, the Company Share Option Plan, which allows them to offer key staff the option to buy shares in the company at a fixed price, free of income tax or national insurance contributions. In April, the government doubled the limit on the maximum value of CSOP options an employee can hold, from £30,000 to £60,000, while relaxing rules on the types of shares eligible.\\nHowever, a smaller and declining number of companies use the SAYE and SIP schemes, designed to offer options or shares to all employees.\\nIndustry representatives have lobbied ministers for reforms they say would boost take-up, in particular reducing the time employees have to hold shares in a SIP in order to qualify for tax breaks, from five to three years.\\n“People with less money have to wait longer for the tax advantage than executives,” said Sarah Anderson, business development manager at RM2, an advisory group, noting that three years was the norm in other schemes.\\nShe added that another potential barrier to take-up was the recent reduction in the tax-free allowance for dividend income, which will drop from £2,000 last year to £500 in 2024-25, meaning many relatively low earners paid dividends through a SIP could be required to fill out a self-assessment tax return.\\nA recent evaluation by HM Revenue & Customs found that awareness of the schemes was low: senior executives of more than half the companies already using them did not even know they were signed up. Some were also worried that employees could gain a controlling interest in the company and about administrative complexity.\\nE arlier research by the Social Market Foundation, published in 2020, found a majority of listed company employees would like to own shares in their employer. However, almost four in 10 of those offered the chance turned it down because they felt they could not afford it.\\nThe Treasury is asking companies and employees what changes would encourage them to participate in the schemes.', metadata={'query': 'Impact of password sharing on subscription services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a9972435-d33c-4a6b-bb1c-bb3078918135', 'title': 'UK aims to boost worker share ownership with overhaul of rules', 'publication_time': '2023-06-05T16:02:18.263Z'}, uuid=UUID('e5072545-3cbb-4fab-b7d0-45b9b342eca9'), db_id=''),\n",

       " 'Changes in consumer behavior regarding streaming services': [(Document(text='\\nAnna Nicolaou\\nEvery week the big cable news networks in the US — CNN, Fox News and MSNBC — blast out press releases touting some kind of ratings achievement. These documents are sometimes specific, and often ultra competitive, with each channel trying to claim the title of “most-watched” on cable.\\nRecently, this obsession with ratings has started to look a bit like musicians playing their violins as the Titanic sinks.\\xa0Cable television is in long-term decline.\\xa0Some recent statistics: every day, about 25,000 Americans cancel their cable cord. The number of US homes receiving cable TV has dwindled to about the same level as in 1992, according to MoffettNathanson, when it was still a relatively new medium.\\nIn the US, less than half of viewership of “TV” actually occurs through traditional television. It is happening, instead, on streaming services.\\xa0The erosion of pay-TV has “already gathered so much momentum that it is now uneconomical for anyone to fight the tide”, analysts at MoffettNathanson said in May. They estimate that 2.3mn Americans cut their cable cords in the first quarter.\\nThis transition has been going on for a while, but the messaging around it has become more urgent. Disney’s Bob Iger this summer casually announced that its linear TV networks “may not be core” to the business, effectively putting these channels up for sale. As head of Disney, Iger’s comments tend to shape conversations in Hollywood, and he seemed to make it official: TV is on the way out.\\nIt’s hard to reckon this backdrop with the quibbling over which cable news channel lured the most 25- to 54-year-olds on any given night.\\xa0But the answer to that question is usually Fox News, Rupert Murdoch’s network, which has fared the best of the lot. Fox News benefits from a loyal\\xa0audience, if ageing like other networks.\\nCNN, meanwhile, has suffered a steeper drop than its peers in the post-Trump media cycle, falling to a distant third place behind the left-leaning MSNBC. On average, only 463,000 people were watching CNN on any given day during the second quarter, down from 1.2mn in the same period in 2020. Among the coveted 25- to 54-year-old demographic, the numbers are more dire: only 94,513 of these people were watching CNN on an average day during the quarter.\\nThese news networks are still pulling in big profits. They make most of their money from licensing fees that cable operators pay to run their programming and — for now — these operators are still paying up. But there will probably come a time when the maths no longer adds up. All these news companies will have to transform their businesses eventually.\\nMurdoch launched “Fox Nation” as a streaming platform for Fox News five years ago, but the company has yet to reveal how many people have signed up for it. In a recently leaked video , former Fox star Tucker Carlson said that “nobody watches Fox Nation because the site sucks”. At $6 a month, Fox Nation would have to attract more than 40mn subscribers to match the $3bn in revenue that Fox News makes under the current system. Analysts estimate that Fox Nation has fewer than 2mn subscribers.\\nCNN’s problems appear more pressing. The company has had three different owners in the past six years and suffered the abrupt exit of longtime leader Jeff Zucker, who had built CNN into a ratings machine during the Trump era. His departure was followed by a brief but tumultuous stint under Chris Licht, who left after a series of controversies.\\nWarner Bros Discovery on Thursday revealed plans to stream live CNN programming on its Max platform next month. Warner is also in talks to bring in Mark Thompson, a respected news veteran who ran the BBC and the New York Times, to right the ship at CNN, according to a person familiar with the matter.\\nBut it is unclear how much WBD chief David Zaslav is willing to invest in a streaming future for CNN, which represents only a small fraction of Warner’s revenue. Warner denies that CNN is for sale, but with $45bn in net debt it is hard to imagine Zaslav would not sell if presented with a decent offer. The earliest he could do so is in April, owing to a stipulation in last year’s merger of Warner with Discovery.\\nNext year’s US presidential election provides hope for these cable news companies. But even it delivers a bump in ratings, the longer term malaise is clear.\\nanna.nicolaou@ft.com\\nThis article has been amended to correct the estimate of the number of subscribers that Fox Nation would have to attract to match the revenue Fox News makes', metadata={'query': 'Changes in consumer behavior regarding streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/299a7544-e1b7-4c11-a3a5-53aff763bcb1', 'title': 'The damning verdict of viewers on US cable TV', 'publication_time': '2023-08-24T14:07:09.800Z'}, uuid=UUID('ced3a1f6-c7e3-49fa-a9c6-29c3f0ae80a7'), db_id=''),\n",

Here’s an article by Alphaville writer Bryce Elder on that.\\nFrom the company’s perspective, subscriptions help them reap steady revenues, rather than having spikes in sales grouped around major product launches. The argument for customers is that subscribing to a service that includes updates is cheaper than paying a large upfront cost every time your software of choice receives a major update. For goods subscriptions, it’s because shopping is difficult and annoying.\\nBut businesses aren’t your friends, so there’s the natural suspicion that subscriptions — by being hard to efficiently monitor and manage — are ultimately costing subscribers more. That dynamic is the subject of a new NBER paper by Liran Einav and Neale Mahoney of Stanford University, and Benjamin Klopack of Texas A&M. They write:\\nRetailers are increasingly selling goods and services via subscriptions instead of spot markets. In this paper, we study one benefit to the retailer of selling subscriptions: the possibility that — presumably because of inattention or inertia — consumers continue to pay for subscriptions after the flow benefit falls below its price.\\nThe authors have used data from a “large” but unspecified US payment card network to monitor this, focusing on cards that have been have been replaced for some reason (they give expiration as an example) — which forces card users to decide whether they want to maintain their current subscriptions, effectively forcing the questions of inattention and inertia:\\nReplaced cards require an active subscription renewal decision, and we document that months during which cards are replaced are associated with much higher rates of cancellation for the ten subscriptions we study. We write down and estimate a stylized model of subscription renewals that allows us to recover the baseline degree of inattention\\nAfter some application of those fancy-looking letters that economists are so fond of:\\nWe find that seller revenues (or equivalently average subscription durations) are significantly higher due to subscriber inattention, with important heterogeneity across services. We estimate that inattention increases firm revenues by between 14% and more than 200%, depending on the service.\\nOne interesting finding is that benefit of subscriber attention (from the subscriber’s perspective at least) varies greatly by service.\\nThe paper models this in part through a hypothetical regulated system where subscribers are made to actively choose to continue their subscriptions at regular intervals. This table shows how the revenue ratio impact would change based on these increments (where ∞ is automatic renewal):\\nThe authors find the effects “are substantial, yet highly heterogeneous”. In one of the example services studied, inattention is seemingly integral. Alphaville’s emphasis below:\\nInattention (relative to “perfect” attention) modestly increases revenues for some services (eg, 14% for service G), but triples revenues for others (service B). 23 In other words, the average subscription duration for service B would drop from its observed duration of over a year to about 4 months if subscribers were fully attentive. It is plausible to suspect that this subscription service would not be viable from a business perspective if not for its subscribers’ inattention.\\nThey note, however, that manual re-subscription could well be seen as a “potentially undesirable remedy”, which is academy speak for “it would be massively bloody annoying”. Indeed, automatic renewal is often a desirable feature.\\nWhat does it mean? Subscriptions are already under scrutiny, particularly as the Federal Trade Commission takes Amazon to court over allegations the ecommerce megalodon manipulated customers into subscribing to Amazon Prime .\\nEvidence that they are they (in)actively cost customers extra money might make them a popular target for the US’s happy-warrior regulators, but the balance between cost and convenience is very delicate.

But even taking account of this shift, the average amount of time spent watching TV and video content across all devices in 2022 was four hours 28 minutes per person per day, about 12 per cent lower than in 2021.\\nClaire Enders, founder of media research company Enders Analysis, pointed to the growth in popularity of video platform YouTube and social network TikTok among younger audiences, with less interest across age groups in news in particular compared with during the pandemic.\\nShe noted it was also significant to see a “massive long-term drop in shows” that regularly attracted several million viewers. Analysts at Enders expect viewing of linear broadcasting to shrink from two-thirds to less than half of total video viewing by 2028 as streaming services such as Netflix advance.\\nThe most watched TV programmes last year were England’s quarterfinal against France in the Fifa World Cup, Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral and the platinum jubilee celebrations.\\nBut the number of programmes pulling in more than 4mn viewers has halved since 2014, suggesting a big drop in “national TV moments” around climactic parts of soap operas, for example, as well as lower audiences for once-dominant evening TV news bulletins.\\nWith only 48 programmes averaging more than 4mn TV viewers on streaming platforms in 2022, Ofcom said its report illustrated “just how fragmented the viewing landscape has become”.\\nThe watchdog found two-thirds of households were using a subscription streaming service in the first quarter of 2023, down from a peak of 68 per cent in the first quarter of last year, suggesting take-up has plateaued.\\nYounger viewers also now rely more on digital apps for on-demand short-form videos, rather than scheduling time for TV programmes.\\nFor the first time, 16 to 24-year-olds watched less broadcast TV on average than children aged between four and 15, prioritising time on apps.

The result was a 5.9mn bump in subscriber numbers in this year’s second quarter that was hailed as a show of strength by some analysts. But this is only a temporary fix.\\nLike ride-sharing company Uber, Netflix priced its streaming service at low rates to attract the biggest audience possible. Like Uber, it was then bombarded by rivals willing to spend large sums to compete. Six years ago, Netflix claimed that its only real competition was sleep. Now it includes comparisons to streaming competitors in its shareholder letter.\\nAs its shareholders grow weary of subsidising online services, prices are rising. NBCUniversal’s Peacock just lifted its cheapest monthly rate by $1 and Disney+’s US revenue per subscriber has picked up by 20 per cent in the past year.\\nThis means Netflix’s increases do not stand out. It is still the sector leader with nearly 239mn subscribers and expects another increase this quarter. But Netflix must spend more on marketing to draw in those subscribers.\\nLower costs are temporary too. In a repeat of the shutdowns that occurred during Covid-19 lockdowns, the Hollywood writers’ strike has stopped production of films and TV shows. That means Netflix will spend less on content. Free cash flow is expected to be at least $5bn this year, up from $1.6bn in 2022. Long-term debt has come down as well to $14.1bn from $14.9bn two years ago. One can sense that the focus is on level-headed financial decisions just by the near total lack of chatter about video games — an expensive endeavour that Netflix is also involved in.\\nBut when all of the users who were sharing passwords pay up or leave, Netflix will have to find new sources of revenue growth. Advertising subscriptions are not yet large enough for Netflix to choose to put a number on them. It is also a crowded field. Everyone, from YouTube to Uber, now tries to attract ad dollars.\\nIf Netflix wants to keep its focus on tweaking payments it could remove monthly subscriptions altogether and reduce churn by offering only annual or 18-month plans. Month-by-month payments were once a way to distinguish streaming from cable TV. That differentiation is no longer necessary.\\nListen to Lex deputy editor Elaine Moore talk to creators, companies and critics about the next era of social media in the FT’s new Tech Tonic podcast series .', metadata={'query': 'Changes in consumer behavior regarding streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/6c76b102-d012-4abd-96d7-54124f7235ef', 'title': 'Netflix: password sharing cutback provides shortlived gain', 'publication_time': '2023-07-20T10:36:06.458Z'}, uuid=UUID('2b79d854-7833-41d8-bf01-ce568b26fe96'), db_id=''),\n",

McKenzie said that while the FSB supported an earlier version of the government’s proposals to make it easier to cancel subscriptions, the Bill went “far beyond the approach consulted on” last year.\\nMeanwhile Sky, responding to MPs examining the bill, said it had “serious concerns” over the plans for subscriptions. The company acknowledged that some industry practices “cause consumer harm” but said the bill’s provisions were “too prescriptive and broadly drawn”.\\nThey “will add significant costs on to businesses — and by extension consumers — for marginal consumer gains”, Sky said, describing the plans as “poor policymaking”. It said that it does not “engage in practices that roll our customers over into long-term contracts that they cannot get out of”.\\nAccording to a government impact assessment published in April, the changes would result in one-off costs of £315mn to businesses.

These could be shown during related shows — for example, light entertainment — but not others.\\nNetflix was a prominent presence at the vast festival of advertising in its first year at the event, hosting a party in a branded hotel on the seafront and an event with ex-footballer David Beckham.\\nNetflix co-chief executive Greg Peters and Jeremi Gorman, president of worldwide advertising at Netflix, spent the week in France courting advertising bosses and brands, according to multiple advertising executives.\\nThey said that their counterparts at Netflix outlined how the US media giant would introduce sophisticated ways for brands to advertise as part of a long-term strategy to redefine how streamers can use their platforms for commercial purposes. This includes allowing brands to more directly target advertising to consumers in ways not possible on linear TV channels.\\nOne Hollywood marketing executive said that the partnership to use Microsoft’s technology was also likely to come to an end next year, which would allow Netflix greater ability to innovate.\\n“They’re building [their own technology] in the background. Once they have their own they’ll do free standing. Microsoft is the interim ad server, but that’ll change when they build their own,” he said.\\n“The plan for Netflix was just to get to market quickly last year. This is not the final way they’re going to do it. They are going to be very creative. There’s going to be a better, a different experience.”\\nOne advertising boss said Netflix would be able to use its data on customers to create more bespoke marketing, albeit in ways still safeguarding customer data protections.\\n“They’ll know what you’ve seen,” he said. “So the old days of making episodic work may be back because before you could never guarantee what people have seen already. Now you can write 15 episodes of an advert and guarantee that the viewer will see them in the right order. So that’s really interesting.”\\nAnother advertising chief said Netflix now made more money per user on its advertising plans than in the standard tier. He said brands had been positive on the idea of using Netflix to market their products, although he added that the size of the audience was still small.\\n“Streaming services thought it would devalue their offer. But actually, it’s massively expanded the reach. Brands are extremely keen to be associated with the Netflix content and now they’re starting to think about much more innovation around the format, much more strategic partnerships.”\\nAnother advertising executive said: “What level of targeting that they start to apply could get really, really interesting. We were keen for some of our brands to use it so that we could see what was coming [but] we can’t correlate exposure to Netflix to sales — it’s just too small. But you can get learning about who saw your ads.”\\nNetflix is also seeking to build out its gaming business to include advertising, noted another ad executive.

On Tuesday it\\xa0combined its HBO Max service — home of Succession , White Lotus and Game of Thrones — with Discovery Plus, which specialises in low-cost unscripted programming such as 90-Day Fiancé . The combined service was renamed Max, and the company hopes the broader offering will increase customer numbers and engagement.\\nDisney chief executive Bob Iger plans a similar move later this year by merging child-friendly Disney Plus and Hulu, which focuses on general entertainment aimed at adults, into one app. Iger said this would boost sales of Disney’s with-adverts subscription packages, another step towards reaching its goal of turning a profit in streaming next year. In the meantime he must also address investor worries about subscriber growth — the company’s streaming services have lost customers for the past two quarters.\\nNetflix may face similar problems of retaining customers as it cuts password sharing options. In early trials, Netflix said some users dumped the service, with as many as 1mn cancellations in Spain alone, according to Kantar. While many return — either adding new accounts or opting for the cheaper ad-supported version — there is still some risk, Chan says.\\n“If people are to cancel their subscription, they will be exposed to life without Netflix” and perhaps switch to other services, she said. “I think people will come back, but they may not regain their whole subscriber base.”', metadata={'query': 'Changes in consumer behavior regarding streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a85f2d38-1889-4108-92af-525ed924b133', 'title': 'Netflix is taking a necessary risk in tackling its 100mn freeloaders', 'publication_time': '2023-05-26T04:00:49.086Z'}, uuid=UUID('1b54bf46-3984-407c-a549-1ca6c6a247ce'), db_id=''),\n",

Today, a rift at the heart of the telecoms sector risks reversing decades of progress and plunging digital allies into a new phase of conflict.\\nEurope’s telecom companies want US corporations such as Alphabet, Netflix, Amazon and Meta to pay for the increasing video traffic they generate. These US giants originate data accounting for around 50 per cent of network loads. Europe’s telcos complain they bear massive additional costs without receiving any fees or extra revenues.\\nFor their part, the US corporations argue that such cross-industry subsidies are a form of protectionism. Indeed, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon already pay for their distribution platforms and related costs for content rights and production. They see these requests as a form of expropriation of their profits, which are much larger than those of the EU telcos.\\nAs a result, member states, industry associations and European MPs stand divided on the issue, while the EU Commission has launched a consultation on the future of the telecoms industry. The discussion over such profound and complex questions will fuel aggressive lobbying from all sides and possibly end up in litigation. Europe instead needs a balanced approach which addresses the legitimate funding requirements of the telecoms companies without unfairly punishing content providers.\\nThere is a strong social argument for ensuring that telcos earn a decent return on capital. At the moment its stands at a meagre 4 per cent, according to a recent analysis of established operators by JPMorgan, which is too low. A higher return would ensure there is adequate investment in ultra-wide and low-latency broadband (fibre and 5G) that would benefit both the welfare of citizens and the companies’ competitiveness. Industrial, agricultural, health, educational and mobility applications need fast, secure and low-latency networks. At the same time, it is clearly in the interest of European citizens that platforms distributing quality content can operate and thrive in Europe. It is right that, rather than feeling squeezed, US corporations contribute a fair proportion of the costs associated with distributing their videos.\\nA sensible compromise would be to only seek contributions from the largest operators — for example those loading above 5 or 7.5 per cent of a single network. These payments could be negotiated bilaterally between platforms and telecom companies, since investment requirements and networks are different. Antitrust authorities and regulators would only need to intervene — granting powers to access information and imposing a mandatory contribution based on\\xa0the existing “abuse of economic dependence” legislation — if no agreement could be reached.\\nThis approach would protect net neutrality and encourage genuine negotiations, reducing the risk of regulatory decisions which take time and often have unintended consequences. A market solution with safeguards is surely better than straight regulation or, worse, inaction.\\nHowever, these changes will not solve the networks’ problems with profitability and investment on their own. The EU should allow more in-market consolidation in the telecoms industry, reduce the support governments give to low-investment operators, and stop facilitating the assignment of frequencies to new entrants: all policies which distort fairness for established networks\\xa0and squeeze them\\xa0for spectrum renewals.\\nIn short, the EU should reward those who are willing to invest. Much as with the transatlantic telegraph cables, all sides stand to gain from a robust, innovative and future-proof European telecoms infrastructure.\\n', metadata={'query': 'Changes in consumer behavior regarding streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/ffc2d92b-ee89-4699-9a10-dc6a477f52a6', 'title': 'Battles over the cost of video traffic are creating a rift across the Atlantic', 'publication_time': '2023-04-30T12:00:19.499Z'}, uuid=UUID('ebdc5330-93fc-41eb-bc3d-482957f3daad'), db_id=''),\n",

In some cases contracts explicitly prohibit programmes from being shown on an ad-supported tier if Netflix ever decided to launch one.\\nStudios have been negotiating with Netflix for months about licences for the service, said people familiar with the matter. Among them is Sony, which does not have a streaming service but has taken an “arms dealer” strategy of selling film and TV rights to the highest bidder.\\n“If you’re Sony, they’re going to take a pound of flesh out,” said an executive at an investment group that acquires media copyright royalties. “It’s like going to a hotel. This [room] has a view of the ocean as opposed to a view of the mountains. You’re going to have to pay more money.”\\nNetflix said the new ad-supported service, which will cost $6.99 a month, is not “a revenue sharing model” at the moment, but the industry expects it will shift that position soon.\\nRecommended\\nFor the studios and talent, the negotiations over the advertising-based streaming service represent a larger opportunity than just a cut of the ad revenue. They also hope to regain some of the performance-based pay, or “back end”, that they have lost in the streaming era.\\nUnder the current system, talent behind Netflix hits such as Squid Game did not share the spoils of their success. “It’s not like Netflix is paying me a bonus. Netflix paid me according to the original contract”, Hwang Dong-hyuk, the creator of the show, said last year .\\nWith its subscription-based model, Netflix has been able to provide far fewer data about how its shows perform than traditional TV networks do. But the company will begin working next year with Nielsen, the ratings service, to gather the detailed data that advertisers demand.\\nA big question is whether this will “lead to a performance-based back end for the creative talent”, said Stephen Saltzman, head of the international entertainment group at law firm Fieldfisher. “I believe that it will put more pressure on Netflix to come up with performance-based metrics and compensation for the creative community.”', metadata={'query': 'Changes in consumer behavior regarding streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/f21e934d-acbe-4c4b-ac15-a3a6460abdd2', 'title': 'Hollywood seeks a cut as Netflix debuts ad-supported streaming', 'publication_time': '2022-11-02T05:01:01.600Z'}, uuid=UUID('3f9cf57b-ba36-490d-b47b-c37cc3ea3146'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nGreg Peters\\nThe writer is chief operating officer of Netflix\\nOld arguments die hard. A decade ago, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic were consumed by a debate about who should foot the bill for the infrastructure that powers the internet. On one side, telecoms companies argued that content providers were “freeriding” on their infrastructure and should pay more. On the other, a coalition led by civil society and consumer groups was lobbying for an open and interoperable web. Ultimately, plans for internet tolls were shelved and “net neutrality” won the day.\\nTen years later and we’re having the same conversation again in Europe, even though recent history has shown that the interests of telcos and content companies are in fact aligned. Last month, the chief executives of 16 European telcos said that companies like Netflix should pay extra on account of the “sizeable costs they currently impose on European networks”. But internet usage is not driven by companies — the traffic is generated by consumers, who pay for higher priced broadband packages precisely because they want fast, high-quality access to great film, TV, games and more. Far from being a cost telcos must bear, entertainment generates the demand which internet service providers (ISPs) need in order to grow, which is why they bundle services like Netflix directly into the consumer packages they offer.\\nISPs benefit directly from Netflix’s $15bn programming budget. We’ve invested more than €4bn in local productions across Europe over the past five years, generating tens of thousands of jobs in the creative economy. We will also contribute more than €1.5bn in European cultural levies and investment obligations over the next three years. For all the concerns about freeriding, these are in fact mutually beneficial relationships from which infrastructure providers and entertainment companies gain economically — and in business terms that seems the very definition of “fairness”.\\nOur partnership with ISPs extends beyond Netflix’s consumer services to the underlying networks at the heart of this debate. We’ve invested more than $1bn in our content delivery network called Open Connect, which we offer free to ISPs. We have 18,000 servers containing our content in 6,000 locations (and growing) across 175 countries. So when consumers press play, the film or TV show is streamed from around the corner — reducing traffic and costs for operators around the world, while also ensuring the highest quality, no-lag experience for our members.\\nLast decade’s dire predictions that the growth in usage was unsustainable unless content providers paid more have proven to be unfounded: internet traffic grew tenfold yet operators’ capital spending remained stable. It’s telling that European telcos’ energy consumption is also forecast to be flat over the next 10 years, despite growing traffic. As research by Analysys Mason (and funded by Netflix) concluded: the “growing demand from end users can be handled sustainably without increasing network costs over time”. This was confirmed by Europe’s telecoms regulators who stated on October 7 that the costs of internet network infrastructure were “not very traffic-sensitive”.\\nA year ago, Squid Game premiered on Netflix and quickly became a global sensation. With 1.6bn hours viewed in its first month, this Korean drama unexpectedly became our biggest TV show ever. We’ve had huge successes with Lupin from France and Casa de Papel from Spain. As consumers and broadcasters shift from linear streaming to on-demand, we want a system that encourages more investment in content and supports more hits like these, whether they’re on Netflix or France Television, Rai, Telecinco, ARD, the BBC or Viaplay.\\nThe internet tolls proposed by telcos today are unconnected to their actual infrastructure deployment costs and would divert significant resources from European content — weakening entertainment companies, the attractiveness of higher-priced broadband packages and undermining Europe’s creative community.\\nTaxing entertainment and media companies to subsidise telcos was a bad idea in 2012, and the same is true today. We need to move on from the debates of yesteryear and recognise that when we work together, and both invest in our respective strengths, we all thrive.', metadata={'query': 'Changes in consumer behavior regarding streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/22d376ec-cb4a-455d-882a-ff15edc1205f', 'title': 'Hitting content providers with internet tolls would damage the web ecosystem', 'publication_time': '2022-10-20T13:33:30.777Z'}, uuid=UUID('e232aaae-8ef3-4195-83c7-4172420f9ca1'), db_id=''),\n",

And earlier this year Netflix announced it would be screening live WWE wrestling for $500mn a year from 2025.\\nUntil recently, streamers had often avoided live sports, largely due to the high costs of rights and technical challenges involved. But the technology has improved to the point where former sticking points, such as picture quality and time lag, are now acceptable to many fans. And while expensive, live sports are a powerful way of targeting multiple demographic segments and driving new subscriptions. Ad revenues are also becoming an increasingly important component of streamers' income. And few things can attract advertisers like live sporting events.\\nFor the sports leagues, streamers have a global reach that is particularly attractive. Netflix alone has more than 270mn subscribers worldwide. But traditional broadcasters are fighting back.\\nEarlier this year, Fox, Disney, and Warner Bros announced the launch of a new streaming platform, Venu Sports.

Meanwhile, in the UK, Sky Sports launched a new streaming service this summer to run alongside its traditional broadcast platform.\\nAnother challenge for streamers is that their interest in sports rights has helped drive up prices. For example, between 2019 and 2024, the value of the US sports rights market grew by 54 per cent, compared to an overall TV industry revenue growth of just 15 per cent. While streamers' spending on sports rights has soared recently, that explosive growth may ease off in the coming years, not least because many of the major sports rights deals still have years to run before renewal.

Most rival platforms — including Netflix, Max, Paramount+ and Disney+ — have brought in an ad-supported tier at a lower price than subscriptions that carry no ads.\\nAnalysts expect Apple to bring ads to its streaming TV+ service soon too. More conventional TV companies are also offering ad-supported streaming services, while Fox’s Tubi only offers shows backed by ads.\\nThe “bundles” that advertisers buy — in different formats and with various services attached — can make direct comparisons difficult. But multiple executives at rival services, as well as advertising bosses, said Amazon was pricing its spots more cheaply than Netflix, although at a higher rate than others such as Disney.\\nThe arrival of Amazon had already forced rivals to reduce their own pricing, according to advertising sources. One rival executive noted Amazon’s “vast supply of inventory”, adding: “There is downward pressure. They knew what they were doing in terms of flipping everybody over into the tier.”\\nAmazon and Netflix declined to comment.\\nAmazon’s arrival has particularly worried executives at rival streamers because of its existing strength in retail that analysts expect will fuel interest in its Prime ad slots.\\nThe ecommerce giant automatically converted all its more than 200mn total global subscribers to the ad tier — unless they actively chose to pay more for the premium ad-free service. That meant Amazon immediately had a huge audience with which to lure advertisers.\\nIt was a “pretty dramatic and contrarian move” and had resulted in a “sudden accumulation of an advertising audience, which is pretty powerful”, said Jonathan Carson, chief executive of industry data provider Antenna.\\nThe company has a vast trove of shopper data and the ability to direct viewers to its online stores.\\nOne US TV executive said competition had noticeably increased since Amazon’s entry, adding that Prime Video ads had “made a big impact”.\\nAmazon has rapidly grown its multibillion-dollar advertising business — driven by ads on its online stores — which generated $11.8bn in sales in the first quarter of 2024, up from $9.5bn in the year-ago period.\\nAnalysts at JPMorgan said in June that the division was Amazon’s “fastest-increasing revenue stream and one of its highest-margin businesses”.\\nThe arrival of Prime Video ads was likely to propel that growth, analysts expect. Citi estimated in January that Prime Video adverts could generate more than $5bn in “high-margin advertising revenue” as it builds up, albeit a figure still substantially below the $19bn Amazon invested in video and music content in 2023.\\nBaird analysts in May said they had seen “healthy demand from both traditional linear and streaming video advertisers” for the new Prime Video ad slots. This year was “the soft rollout of Prime streaming ads” with a “bigger step-up” expected in 2025, Baird said.\\nChief executive Andy Jassy has said he believes that Prime Video can be “a large and profitable business on its own”.\\nAdvertising executives said Amazon offered brands the chance to target specific audiences thanks to the data it has from its retail platform.\\nPrime Video adverts were “the perfect closed loop attribution that we’ve been waiting for on linear TV” because “Amazon knows who you are” and what a viewer has bought on the Amazon.com website, said Citi analyst Ron Josey. “It’s a very large opportunity for them.”\\nIn May, Amazon announced “shoppable” ad formats for Prime Video to allow viewers to add products to their Amazon shopping cart during ad breaks using their smart TV remotes.\\nOne ad executive said that every brand was interested in “higher efficiency and more targeting” — both of which were being offered by Amazon.\\nHasbro adopted Prime Video advertising for a six-week test run in the UK, using Amazon first-party data to target parents. It found that two-thirds of Peppa Pig purchases during that period were new to the brand, adding that sales for those toy products on Amazon had increased 18 per cent, year on year.\\n“There is a sales pitch which has a buy one buy all, but when you get into it it's not quite there yet,” said another ad exec, pointing to the range of retail and video options as well as Twitch, the gaming platform. “But they will get there.”\\nAccording to Antenna’s Carson, the number of Prime subscribers who paid to opt out of ads was pretty substantial at first but quickly “trailed off”. At the end of May, less than a tenth had paid more for no advertising, they found.\\nOther streamers are also having success on their ad-supported tiers as cost-conscious consumers look at how many subscriptions they can maintain. Netflix has said that it has 40mn monthly active users globally on its ad tier, attracting between 40-50 per cent of new sign-ups.\\nAd plans had gone from 28 per cent to 38 per cent of the premium streaming market in the past two years, and made up more than half of gross additions for the first time in the last quarter of 2023, and first of 2024, according to Antenna.\\nThe focus on bolstering Prime Video’s financials marked a change from how Amazon had originally conceived of the streaming service, former company insiders said, seen at one time as a way to get consumers to sign up for the Prime subscription service.\\nAmazon’s Prime Video and Studios divisions were among those hit by lay-offs this year as the company sought to cut costs across the board and after big spending on blockbuster shows such as the Lord of the Rings series.\\nBut analysts and ad executives say there is more than enough content on Prime — new and old — to ensure that Amazon can take a dominant position in the market for advertising for streamers.\\n“It’s their playbook. Amazon has always been like a company that builds massive market share, then they monetise it,” said one ad executive. “You see they did that with ecommerce. They did that with cloud computing, and they’re now doing it with their ads business.”\", metadata={'query': 'Changes in consumer behavior regarding streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/d45c4153-6c11-4f1e-9009-62f8adf5ac2b', 'title': 'Amazon Prime Video undercuts rival Netflix on advertising prices', 'publication_time': '2024-07-30T04:00:28.402Z'}, uuid=UUID('c2e2ac3e-1e4b-4282-a73b-c260edeff183'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nNetflix has won the streaming war . Now it needs to win the advertising one.\\xa0That will be easier said than done.\\nThe company remains the undisputed leader in video streaming. Last week, it threw up another big quarter of subscriber and revenue growth, adding more than 8mn net new subscribers from April to June. Revenue rose 17 per cent to $9.6bn while net income jumped by nearly a third.\\nFuelling the growth was last year’s decision to crack down on password sharing and introduce a lower-priced subscriber plan with advertising. Hit shows such as Bridgerton and Baby Reindeer also helped attract viewers.\\nAt a time when rival streaming services are struggling to gain customers and make a profit, Netflix , with its 27 per cent operating margin and robust free cash flows, is the envy of the sector. Its shares have traded accordingly. The stock, up 35 per cent over the past 12 months, hit a new high this month. At about 30 times forward earnings, it commands a premium over rival streaming operators.\\nBut the subscriber surge from the password crackdown cannot last. User growth will slow. This could come as soon as the next quarter, with tougher comparatives from last year. Netflix plans to stop reporting quarterly subscriber numbers starting next year.\\nIt’s a questionable move that may backfire. Without insight into subscriber growth, investors will be forced to focus on other metrics. Netflix will need to start making more money from advertising to maintain its share price gains.\\nThe problem is Netflix is still a minnow in advertising. While YouTube and Amazon have well-oiled ad machines, Netflix is only starting to build its own ad-tech platform. Analysts at Emarketer forecast Netflix will generate $760mn in advertising revenue this year. That would translate into just a 2.7 per cent market share of the so-called connected TV ad business. Hulu and YouTube each have 12 per cent, while Amazon has 11 per cent.\\nNetflix’s cheaper, ad-supported tier has over 40mn global monthly active users. It needs to work harder to monetise these customers. That means showing more ads, or even introducing ads to its other ad-free tiers. At Amazon’s Prime Video, showing ads is the default mode. Customers have to pay more to avoid ads.\\nBut people pay for Amazon Prime for free delivery. Video is just gravy. Netflix customers will have less tolerance for ads, and for being asked to pay more to stay ad-free. After years of pitching itself as an ad-free alternative to traditional TV, Netflix faces its toughest battle yet.\\npan.yuk@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Changes in consumer behavior regarding streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/77d72ba7-5f08-4ba4-b6bd-6c2a94a8a635', 'title': 'Netflix faces tough battle in advertising wars', 'publication_time': '2024-07-22T08:35:39.188Z'}, uuid=UUID('397f99cd-f39e-4abb-a0a4-612927c5f494'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nChloe Cornish in Dubai and Ahmed Al Omran in Jeddah\\nMedia group MBC is competing hard with Netflix to become the Middle East’s biggest streaming service, pushing a wide range of Arabic TV shows and films and its offer of free programmes supported by advertising.\\nThe Riyadh-listed entertainment company, which is majority owned by the Saudi government and is the region’s largest broadcaster, now commands 22 per cent of the Middle East and north Africa $1bn streaming market through its Shahid division. This puts it 4 per cent ahead of regional rival Starz Play Arabia and 5 per cent ahead of Netflix, according to industry analyst Omdia.\\nMBC has poured money into streaming in the past four years, pinning its hopes for growth on Shahid, which is not yet profitable, to cater for increasing viewer numbers, particularly in the oil-rich Gulf states. Shahid reported SR900mn ($240mn) in losses between 2020 and the first half of 2023.\\nTelevision is “not where we’re going to get the growth from”, MBC’s chief executive Sam Barnett told the Financial Times. “We’re getting similar [TV] viewership we had in previous years. We’re maintaining market share. It’s the media that is changing\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009we are seeing the shift of people to using [streaming].”\\nShahid says it now has 4.8mn paying subscribers in the region, while 20mn regularly watch its advertising-supported streaming service, which attracts viewers with long-running dramas such as Love Game , an Arabic version of a Turkish series about a woman’s attempts to marry a rich shoe designer to help her indebted brother.\\nBarnett said MBC had defied critics who said “the global streamers are coming to eat your lunch. You are this parochial Middle Eastern company. There’s no way you can stand up to\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009Netflix and Disney+ and HBO Max.”\\nThe shift from television to streaming has challenged broadcasters worldwide, but in a region lacking reliable TV audience data, it also presents an opportunity. Viewers in the Middle East’s more than 20 countries are polled only occasionally, often through surveys commissioned by media companies themselves. But streaming services allow media companies to see what customers are watching and how much advertising they are exposed to.\\nMBC’s streaming bet is also helped by demographics: more than 55 per cent of the Middle East and north Africa’s population are under 30, compared with 36 per cent across OECD countries. They are both digital savvy and keen for content, while expecting the same high production values they see on the likes of Netflix. To meet these expectations, Shahid is funding local talent as well as recruiting foreign producers and directors to make content.\\nBarnett described management’s approach to making new programmes as “constructively paranoid about everything”, adding that to try to keep spending at reasonable levels “I have all the creatives in the room, and then I sit them down with the accountants. And we have difficult meetings.”\\nThat approach appears to be working. Shahid lost SR6mn in the first three months of this year, but the figure is improving as subscription and advertising revenues rise. Losses for the same period last year were SR102mn. At the same time, revenues rose 72 per cent year on year to SR298mn, boosted by Ramadan falling in the first quarter. Families traditionally tune in to month-long TV series during that time, making it a top period for advertising spending.\\nKarim Sarkis, a media and entertainment specialist at consultancy Strategy&, said Shahid’s free streaming service and Arabic-language shows and films are helping it compete with Netflix.\\nThose anticipating that Netflix would commission large amounts of Arabic language content have been disappointed, Sarkis said, while “MBC have also woken up in the meantime\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009if they continue competing in the same way\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009I think the [long term] winner is going to be Shahid”.\\nFounded in London in 1991 as the Arab world’s first private satellite channel, the Middle East Broadcasting Corporation was an unusual commercial player in a regional media industry dominated by state-owned networks — that are crucial for projecting soft power — and billionaires’ vanity projects.\\nIts recent history has had TV-worthy moments of drama. In November 2017, founder and chair Waleed bin Ibrahim Al Ibrahim was caught up in an anti-corruption campaign orchestrated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, where hundreds of members of Saudi Arabia’s elites were detained in the Ritz-Carlton hotel and forced to transfer cash and assets to the government.\\nFollowing the incident, Ibrahim’s ownership fell from 100 to 40 per cent of the company while an investment company owned by the finance ministry took the other 60 per cent. It sold a part of that stake in an initial public offering last year and since the listing, MBC’s share price is up about 30 per cent to SR44.\\nThe government still owns more than half of MBC’s shares but Ibrahim retained the chairmanship and is actively involved in the business. Barnett said: “Like many big media moguls, he has strong opinions on content.”\\nGauging which shows will work is critical, Barnett said. Many countries in the region have strict content rules and some streamers have been rebuked by regional regulators for showing scenes such as same-sex kissing. In 2019, Netflix was forced to remove an episode of a comedy show after a complaint by Saudi Arabia, adding to concerns about political interference.\\nMBC and Shahid try “to approach the line, but not fall over it so you are alienating your audiences”, Barnett said, citing this year’s Kuwaiti drama Zawja Waheda La Takfi ( One Wife Is Not Enough ), which tackled the subject of polygamy.\\nBut some of Shahid’s original content has caused controversy. A mini-series on the 1988 hijacking of a Kuwaiti aircraft was pulled in response to protests from the country’s information ministry. The streamer also delayed showing a major television series in early 2021, based on the true story of a Saudi drug trafficker, after his tribe said it was insulting.\\nBeyond content, Shahid has tried to cater to the large and often multigenerational families in the region by allowing up to 20 devices to connect to each subscription.\\n“We are trying to establish what’s the right balance, because like all streamers, we also see abuse of password sharing,” said Natasha Matos-Hemingway, chief commercial, marketing and product officer of Shahid. However, “we’d be hurt very badly if we were to reduce [device allowances] to like two or three”.', metadata={'query': 'Changes in consumer behavior regarding streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/c20b3bbc-b3a7-46c0-91ea-88e60501d922', 'title': 'How Saudi Arabia’s MBC came to dominate Middle East streaming', 'publication_time': '2024-07-07T04:00:28.440Z'}, uuid=UUID('4a28128a-3dbf-4e58-b9c8-e95e4fd8ef82'), db_id=''),\n",

It will launch in the coming weeks.\\nThese will include shows from US entertainment giants such as Disney, NBCUniversal and Sony Pictures, as well as its original content and productions from large, overseas markets in India and Nigeria.\\nThe move comes months after Murdoch’s existing TV service in the UK, TalkTV, which is owned by his News UK operations, closed its linear TV operations for a digital-only platform.\\nFox Corp bought Tubi in a $440mn deal overseen by chief executive Lachlan Murdoch in 2020. It has become one of the fastest growing streamers in the US, offering viewers a video on-demand service without the need to register or subscribe.\\nThe service is instead funded by advertising. Tubi has struck deals with the major connected TV suppliers to appear on their devices as well through mobile phones and the internet.\\nThe move comes as rivals such as Netflix, Disney and Amazon have introduced advertising to their platforms, with paid subscriptions priced at a higher level for their ad-free services.\\nRival services have been raising prices over the past year as they seek to turn growth into profits after a multiyear investment spree on content.\\nTubi has gained in popularity as a result, taking the most total viewing time in the US according to data from Nielsen in May. Tubi has nearly 80mn monthly active users, and has been particularly\\xa0popular with younger audiences.\\nAnjali Sud, chief executive of Tubi, said it was growing fast as rival streamers raised their prices but cut back on content spend.

       "  (Document(text='\\nRichard Waters\\nWhat do the game streaming service Twitch, music app Spotify and video streamer Max all have in common? This week, they all raised prices for at least some of their subscribers, joining what has come to feel like a stampede by digital services of all kinds in 2024 to charge more.\\nThere is no mystery behind this spate of price rises. Streaming may have become the preferred business model for large parts of the media industry, but for most it has also been chronically unprofitable — particularly in the video world, where it has put a severe dent in the multichannel TV model that was long a reliable money-spinner.\\nFor now, the pricing actions have not done much to depress subscriber numbers, encouraging some companies to push through more than one round of increases. But they signal that streaming is entering a new phase, where the headlong race for user growth is over and new forces will determine which comes out on top.\\nSpotify, founded 18 years ago, has yet to report a profitable year, while the chief executive of the 13-year-old Twitch, now a subsidiary of Amazon, also said in January that it loses money. Warner Bros Discovery, owner of Max, at least broke into the black in streaming last year, making it the first traditional media conglomerate to do so. But it made a negligible profit on more than $10bn of revenue.\\nOne notable thing about the higher subscription costs is that, at least until recently, most streamers chose to hold prices down in a race to attract users. Twitch, which raised the cost of its lowest subscription tier by 20 per cent, to $5.99 a month, had never had a price increase in the US before.\\nAfter dipping their toes in the water, though, some are starting to see price increases as a repeatable tactic. Spotify kept its subscription unchanged, at $10 a month, for more than a decade before raising it by $1 last year. This week, it announced another $1, with even bigger percentage increases for family and other premium subscription plans.\\nSpotify’s subscriber numbers have continued to rise strongly — one reason its stock price has soared fourfold since the start of last year. By 2031, Midia Research forecasts music streamers will be able to push through three more broad rounds of price increases, while also introducing new, higher-priced tiers of super-premium services.\\nTatiana Cirisano, senior music industry analyst at Midia, says music streaming has turned out to be a “stickier” service than many might have thought: subscribers tend to stay not just because of a familiar brand, but because they have spent time assembling playlists, while a service’s algorithms have learnt their preferences.\\nHigher prices are also set to usher in a new phase in the battle between digital services of all kinds. As consumers feel the pinch from paying for multiple high-priced premium services, getting a discount for buying a package of services starts to become more attractive — something that encourages the recreation of the very media bundles that standalone streaming services helped to destroy.\\nThis reflects a familiar pattern in the media business. Waves of unbundling, as old media packages are picked apart, are often followed by re-bundling. Consumers get more for a single payment — though one side-effect is that they also often end up, once again, paying for things they do not want. For media owners, meanwhile, selling a package also lowers overall customer acquisition costs and reduces churn of accounts.\\nIn video streaming, Disney has reported success with adding Hulu to its Disney+ video offering , and is planning to do the same with its ESPN+ sports service. Cross-company bundles are also in the works, with a Disney+, Hulu and Max subscription package promised for later this year.\\nAs these new media bundles start to form, new competitors will loom large. Amazon’s Prime, which combines video with free ecommerce deliveries, and Apple One, which includes six of the iPhone maker’s services, including iCloud storage, have shown Big Tech’s willingness to experiment with unconventional offerings that traditional media companies cannot match. Google has also included access to its latest AI models for some subscribers, though it has not gone as far in bundling all its subscription services together. The potential of these tech groups to combine many different types of services and to up-sell to their billions of users are likely to make them formidable competitors in the next phase of the streaming wars.\\nrichard.waters@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Changes in consumer behavior regarding streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/e77d07d8-2997-40f3-b3ba-3577fb097368', 'title': 'The next phase of the streaming wars', 'publication_time': '2024-06-06T16:44:43.216Z'}, uuid=UUID('fcb08b8a-ffa3-42f7-ad07-36b3241f754f'), db_id=''),\n",

Most homes use both options, though the balance is shifting online.\\nThose households more likely to rely only on terrestrial TV included people who were older, less affluent, or had a disability, Ofcom said.\\nBroadcast 2040+, a campaign group to safeguard terrestrial TV and radio after 2040, said: “Without certainty about its future, millions who use and rely on broadcast services, including many of the most vulnerable in society and those who cannot or do not wish to pay for superfast broadband or who lack digital skills, face the threat of TV exclusion.”\\nMore people are shunning TV altogether for social media or other internet services, however.\\nRecommended\\nOfcom said the average person in the UK spent a quarter less time watching daily broadcast TV in 2023 than in 2018, at 149 minutes.

Including the likes of Google and Amazon, in 2022, Britain’s average digital ad spend was a little over £900 per household.\\nThis system’s main benefit is that it is accessible to those without much cash. Personalisation should save people from scrolling through irrelevant ads (Car insurance! Package holidays! Zimmer frames!). Some economists have even argued that targeted digital advertising has increased the variety of stuff Americans consume.\\nSuppose though that regulators woke up one morning feeling meddlesome. Suppose they announced a ban on “free” ad-supported services, no more tracking and no more temptations to buy an avocado slicer late at night in the hope it will transform your life.\\nRegulators would (of course) still allow platforms to make money. Some would have a head start in the subscriptions business. Alphabet claims that YouTube, for example, squeezes more value from its paying subscribers than the ad-supported sort.\\nHard evidence of what might happen is thin. One recent working paper argued that switching to a subscription-based model could mean platforms try harder to give users a good time, rather than maximising eyeballs on ads and short-term engagement. It refers to an experiment in which hiding (user-defined) “toxic” content on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter (now X) reduced the time people spent there. But on Twitter it increased the number of retweets, which they see as a sign of an improved user experience.\\nIt is possible that making people pay upfront would help with the problem of “digital addiction”. Although many people are happy with their social media use, one study estimated that about a third of it is the result of self-control problems. Those less immune to “digital fentanyl” might be grateful for an upfront price to give them pause.\\nAn even more intrusive regulator concerned about people consuming more online content than they really want could mandate a model in which people paid for what they watched. Retailers would never get away with an “all you can smoke” offering. If vendors of viral videos faced similar constraints, perhaps they would be associated with fewer feelings of regret.\\nI doubt any social media executives are praying that my noodling makes it into the real world. And there are good reasons to be sceptical that a switch to a subscriber model would make much difference. Competition between platforms provides strong incentives to keep users engaged. And Matthew Gentzkow of Stanford University, one of the authors of the digital addiction study, points out that part of the focus on short-term engagement is that longer-term measures of welfare are hard to find.\\nThe recent example of Meta introducing paid-for versions of Facebook and Instagram suggests that incremental change is unlikely to have major effects. There is no evidence of a subscription rush, or of any difference in the surface-level user experience, beyond the lack of ads.\\nIndeed, everyone seems miffed. Regulators are asking questions about how the “pay or consent” model was implemented, including whether consumers faced “pressure” to accept the ads option. In February, a European consumer protection group complained that the move was a “smokescreen” for problematic data processing. Meta itself has stated its philosophical objections to charging, and that it is simply trying to follow “overlapping EU regulatory obligations with differing compliance deadlines”.\\nLive discussions include whether the implicit price of the existing advertising model is too high. That comes amid growing chatter about the virtues of “contextual adverts”, based on a web page’s content rather than a viewer’s profile. Another is whether the cost of the alternative is low enough. Meta has offered to lower the price to €6 a month but faces queries from the European Commission about how exactly the new offering works.\\nWhoever would have thought that a simple economic tweak might not solve a complicated problem?

On Tuesday, three titans — Disney, Warner Brothers Discovery and Fox — announced yet another streaming service . The trio will provide their live sports content via one streaming platform.\\nSports-as-a-package is already widely available. It is the backbone of traditional linear pay TV. The new joint venture gets at the heart of the dilemma of modern TV viewership.\\nStreaming is no doubt the future. But a fragmented marketplace renders any single streaming service unprofitable. Stapling disparate services together heralds the ultimate package: M&A consolidation.\\nThe new deal could speed up the move away from traditional cable TV while copying cable TV’s bundling model.\\nTo see why this is required look at Disney’s sports network ESPN, one of the biggest puzzles in media. It generates about $16bn of annual revenue and $3bn to $4bn of ebitda. But those formidable numbers are slowly melting away. A decade ago there were 100mn pay TV households. That figure has dropped to 70mn. ESPN charges distributors $8 or $9 per month per subscriber, whether they want the sports channel or not.\\nIn a world of streaming, consumers can more easily opt out of paying for programming they don’t want.\\xa0Disney has debuted a standalone ESPN streaming service but it knows there may not be an audience big enough to support spending billions of dollars on sports rights. The valuation multiple now ascribed to ESPN may be too low for Disney’s business, which includes theme parks and the movie studio. But ESPN’s annual cash flow is too valuable to give up in a sale or spin-off.\\nEarlier this week, the commissioner of the National Football League said that a streaming-only Super Bowl would not happen soon. The prediction reveals how vital legacy television remains for content producers.\\nYet the broadcaster showing this year’s game, Paramount, is traditional television’s most distressed provider. A relative minnow, it has an enterprise value of just $25bn. By evaluating takeover bids, it recognises that even offering one of the world’s most watched sporting events does not ensure it can survive independently.\\nBundling digital services could help to solve that problem. Offering packages of TV services is not a novel concept. Hulu and YouTube have live TV options while Amazon Prime offers access to multiple channels.

Under pressure to stem losses, entertainment companies are opting to sell more of their content to Netflix. By waiting out its rivals, Netflix has eclipsed them.\\nIt has done this through a vast, debt-fuelled expansion followed by concerted cost cutting. When entertainment companies first competed in streaming they began by hoarding their most popular TV shows and films. The loss of shows like Friends put pressure on Netflix to build up its own back catalogue. It expanded into reality TV, romcoms and international series while handing over large sums of money to well-known showrunners such as Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy. By 2021, annual content spend in cash terms exceeded $17bn.\\nThe price Netflix paid for all that content was falling margins and a heavy debt load that exceeds $14bn. While the pandemic added millions of new subscribers, competition and subscription fatigue led to a subsequent dip in 2022. Netflix’s operating margin dropped sharply from 21 per cent to 18 per cent. The company’s market cap traded below Disney’s.\\nBy focusing on operating margins, Netflix has staged a comeback . It has cracked down on password sharing, promoted an advertising-supported subscription tier and raised prices.\\nBut the real change has come from cost cutting, aided by a writers’ strike in Hollywood that halted productions. While revenue rose 6.6 per cent in 2023, net income rose 20 per cent. Not only has the operating margin recovered but chief financial officer Spencer Neumann is predicting a margin of up to 24 per cent this year — a new high for the company.\\nCompare Netflix with Disney and Netflix comes out ahead, as its market cap now indicates. Disney’s direct-to-consumer unit, which includes streaming service Disney+, is still reporting large operating losses. Activist investor Nelson Peltz says Disney’s streaming service should target “ Netflix-like margins ” of 15 to 20 per cent. This might be achieved by cutting back on content spend and licensing more content — two moves that would further serve Netflix.\\xa0Dearth of new content elsewhere may explain why Netflix is still adding new subscribers.\\nFor Netflix, this may still be a partial victory. Streaming remains an expensive business with low revenue per subscriber. YouTube is more popular than any streaming service and much of its content is created for free by users. Its revenue is mainly advertising, with subscriptions a bonus. The business is part of Google’s Services business, which boasts an operating margin of 35 per cent.\\nCompare Netflix with YouTube instead of Disney and the model looks altogether less appealing.\\nLex is the FT’s concise daily investment column.

Physical formats, such as CDs and vinyl albums, will recede to 13 per cent of revenue in 2027, from nearly 17 per cent in 2022, Omdia says.\\nEven as streaming services have expanded to many countries around the globe, Omdia expects North America to remain the bedrock of music spending by a wide margin.\\nThe region will account for 43.2 per cent of global recorded music buying in 2027, down only slightly from 43.9 per cent in 2022, Omdia analysts forecast. Europe will maintain its number two spot, with 27 per cent of global music spending, the consultancy adds.\\nSpotify launched a decade and a half ago, and hundreds of millions of people across the world now pay a monthly fee to stream music. The streaming pioneer reached 226mn paying subscribers at the end of September.\\nBut the early land-grab of new subscribers is slowing in some regions, leaving the music industry to find ways to keep up momentum and fuel future growth. “The days of high double-digit growth are long gone”, Omdia warns. “Developed countries all face the problem of what to do when the subscriber pool dries up”.\\nCountries to watch 2023-2027\\nUS Developments in the world’s biggest recorded-music market will flow through to the rest of the world\\nChina Leading services are adding users in increasingly significant numbers\\nBrazil Once a global top five market, recent subscription gains could signal the country’s return to the industry’s top ranks\\nIndia Despite persistently low per-capita sales, the population size means the country cannot be ignored\\nSource: FT-Omdia Digital Economies Index\\nIn the US, this slowdown has already begun. Last year, US recorded music revenue rose 6 per cent compared with the prior year, to $15.9bn, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, the trade group. This was its slowest growth rate since 2016, when the business had just begun to bounce back from its piracy-driven downturn.\\nIn the next phase of music streaming’s evolution, Omdia analysts suggest that streaming companies will need to strike a balance with pricing.\\nInvestment bank TD Cowen notes that the amount consumers spend on music relative to their other expenses is less than half of the level it reached during the 1990s. “Not only is music still relatively inexpensive; the product has also improved significantly, with streaming services offering access to a library of virtually all music ever created on easily portable devices”, says analyst Doug Creutz. Against this backdrop, he expects further price rises in the coming years.\\nGoldman Sachs analysts believe that the monetisation of music has “significantly lagged consumption” and also expect price rises “on a regular basis, especially in an environment of higher inflation”.\\nWhen Spotify launched in 2008, “the environment for recorded music sales was completely different”, says Simon Dyson, Omdia analyst. “Piracy was still horrendous. There was still lots of free music floating around. The $9.99 [price] was in line with the price of a CD.”\\nIt would take more than a decade for Spotify to raise the price of its standard subscription in the US, the world’s largest recorded music market. The streaming group announced a $1 rise in July of this year, with Americans now paying $11 a month to stream all the world’s music. Spotify said the price rise would help the company “keep innovating in changing market conditions”. Rival Apple Music last year raised the price of its music subscription to $11 a month.\\nDyson anticipates that Spotify will continue raising prices by $1 every year going forward. “It’s very underpriced for what it’s offering,” he says. “Even if they do a price rise next year and the year after, I think it will still be underpriced.”\\nEarly financial results suggest Spotify has pricing power. During the quarter when Spotify raised prices, the group still managed to sign up 6mn new subscribers, above the 4mn it had forecast. The group also turned a profit for the first time in more than a year. Chief executive and co-founder Daniel Ek said the results proved that Spotify could become a “great business”.\\n“Because of our confidence in our product and our ever-expanding content offering, we felt the timing was right to raise prices”, Ek, the 40-year-old billionaire, told investors on an earnings call.\\nOmdia analysts believe that music companies and streaming services “need to be more proactive” in offering different pricing and subscription options. At the moment, Spotify, Apple, Amazon, YouTube and others all offer a similar catalogue of songs at similar prices. Omdia expects these services will need to differentiate themselves in the same way that Netflix and video platforms do, with exclusive content.\\nSpotify has made strides towards this, making a push into podcasts and audiobooks with the goal of expanding its scope to all things audio — not just music. Spotify is even offering UK and Australia subscribers 15 hours of audiobook listening per month at no extra cost, an offer that it plans to expand to the US in the coming months.\\nHowever, Omdia analysts expect streaming companies will eventually need to split some of these offerings into different subscription tiers or add-ons. “It may seem like a good idea to increase the breadth of content to limit churn, but continuing to keep all audio content in a single silo really is a recipe for disaster,” they warn.', metadata={'query': 'Changes in consumer behavior regarding streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1e3c5cca-75ba-4846-8ccd-d20dc6534e06', 'title': 'North America set to keep its grip on music streaming', 'publication_time': '2023-11-06T05:30:57.575Z'}, uuid=UUID('a38fefce-4c8d-41a9-b849-fe9d411d1421'), db_id=''),\n",

But after Walt Disney, NBCUniversal, Paramount and the then Time Warner launched their own streaming services, they pulled many of their shows from Netflix to avoid feeding a company that had grown into an arch-competitor.\\nWith legacy media groups under pressure to produce streaming profits, however, licensing revenue is looking attractive again — even if it comes from Netflix. This summer, Warner Bros Discovery’s HBO network began licensing a handful of older shows to Netflix, including Insecure , Six Feet Under, Ballers and Band of Brothers.\\n“Conventional wisdom of the last 10 years was that you keep everything in house,” said Casey Bloys, HBO’s chief executive, at the recent Code conference. “But in the history of television, syndication — selling a show somewhere else — was the brass ring. It meant the show was successful and would have a life elsewhere.”\\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley said the return of licensing deals was a “long-term positive” for Netflix and would “pad” its lead over competitors in streaming. But the bank added that the cost of licensing — along with the Netflix’s investments in gaming and other sectors — could add pressure to its profit margins in 2024. The analysts raised their outlook for Netflix’s overall cash spending next year by $500mn to $17.7bn.\\nNetflix will report results on Wednesday, with investors expected to focus on whether it plans to increase subscription prices and signs of progress on its new advertising tier. The latest data on its password sharing crackdown will also be watched.\\nThe return of licensing deals has coincided with strikes in Hollywood, which halted production of new shows and are expected to delay TV and movie releases well into next year. The Writers Guild of America reached a deal with the studios in September after five months, but the SAG-AFTRA union representing actors is still on strike. Those talks collapsed last week after the union asked for a share of subscriber revenue from streamers, studio officials say.\\nDespite the gloom around the strikes, the studios’ experiments with licensing deals appear to have given some old shows new life. After NBCUniversal licensed its show Suits — which aired from 2011-19 and starred Meghan Markle — to Netflix in June, the show experienced a revival. The legal drama was in the top spot on the Nielsen Streaming top 10 for three months, an example of the “Netflix effect” on older shows.\\nBloys said licensing shows to Netflix had also boosted traffic for the programmes on Warner Discovery’s Max streaming platform, home to HBO programming including Ballers , a sports drama that ran from 2015-19. Ballers entered the Nielsen top 10 after it went to Netflix, and Insecure , a comedy starring Issa Rae that ran from 2016-21, had a similar boost.\\n“Without doing a thing on Max, the engagement on Ballers and Insecure really saw a spike when they were on Netflix,” he said at the Code conference. “The initial experiment we had with a couple of titles has had an immediate positive impact on Max.”\\nThere are limits, Bloys added, naming two popular HBO shows that may remain off-limits on Netflix. “I doubt you’ll see Succession or White Lotus , he said.', metadata={'query': 'Changes in consumer behavior regarding streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/fd84f6bb-b3e1-4691-9b90-f6f90c16bae6', 'title': '‘Netflix effect’ returns as studios license old shows to their streaming rival', 'publication_time': '2023-10-17T04:00:12.781Z'}, uuid=UUID('9e43f5cb-9df2-4d9e-9f6d-a51f930fe359'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nTim Harford\\nOne of the modern classics of economics is an article from 2006 with the self-explanatory title “Paying Not to Go to the Gym”, in which researchers Stefano DellaVigna and Ulrike Malmendier studied the behaviour of nearly 8,000 gym members and found it “difficult to reconcile with standard preferences and beliefs”.\\nBy that, they meant that gym members seemed to be delusional, weak-willed or both. People on a monthly contract paid more per visit than those who simply showed up and paid at the door, suggesting they either had a very basic problem with arithmetic or, more likely, optimistic expectations about how often they would exercise. People on the rolling monthly contract also tended to let more than two months elapse between the last visit and the moment they got round to cancelling their\\xa0membership.\\nFor nerds like me, the article has an important message about the field of behavioural economics . We’ll get to that. There’s also a broader question. The subscription business model has expanded from traditional products, such as newspapers and gym memberships to software, streaming media, vegetable boxes, shaving kits, makeup, clothes and support for creative types via Patreon or Substack. We should all be asking ourselves, if so many people are paying not to go to the gym, what else are we paying not to do?\\nA new working paper from economists Liran Einav, Benjamin Klopack and Neale Mahoney attempts an answer. Using data from a credit and debit card provider, they examine what happens to subscriptions for 10 popular services when the card that is paying for them is replaced. At this moment, the service provider suddenly stops getting paid and must contact the customer to ask for updated payment details.\\nYou can guess what happens next: for many people, this request reminds them of a subscription they had stopped thinking about and immediately prompts them to cancel it. Relative to a typical month, cancellation rates soar in months when a payment card is replaced — from 2 per cent to at least 8 per cent. Einav and his colleagues use this data to estimate how easily many people let stale subscriptions continue. Relative to a benchmark in which infallible subscribers instantly cancel once they decide they are no longer getting enough value, the researchers predict that subscribers will take many extra months — on average 20 — to get around to cancelling.\\nDon’t take the precise numbers too seriously — as with most social science, this is not a rigorously controlled experiment but an attempt to tease meaning out of noisy real-world data. What you should take seriously is the likelihood that you are swimming in barely noticed subscriptions, some of which you would choose to cancel if you were forced to pay attention to them for a few minutes. Perhaps you should. Come to think of it, perhaps I should.\\nBut I promised a geeky lesson about behavioural economics too. Loyal readers will have noted some recent scandals in behavioural science: experiments conducted separately by two well-known researchers, Dan Ariely and Francesca Gino, have been found (in the opinion of independent experts) to contain manipulated or fraudulent data. Both deny wrongdoing.\\nIn the light of this dismaying situation, it would be understandable if people lost a bit of confidence in the field of behavioural economics. So it is worth reminding ourselves of what behavioural economics is trying to achieve. The field has long aimed to bring some psychological realism to economics, whose traditional textbook model has no room for people who take out a gym membership, fail to go to the gym and then neglect to cancel the gym subscription.\\nIts founding member is the co-author of Nudge , Nobel memorial prize winner Richard Thaler . Thaler’s project has always been not to argue that the textbook model is contradicted by laboratory experiments, but that it is contradicted by the way that important markets work in the real\\xa0world.\\nIt is certainly reasonable to ask how many experiments in social psychology may have been fraudulently manipulated. Less outrageous, but of more practical significance, is the possibility that many experiments in social psychology are poorly reported and analysed. As I’ve argued recently, we need to strengthen the foundations of scientific practice to prevent this.\\nEconomists can certainly learn from experiments, but contact with reality should be an important part of economics, which is — or should be — a practical subject.\\nRecommended\\nWhether we are sticking closely to the old textbook model or embracing the latest ideas from behavioural science, our concepts should be taken more seriously when they explain what we see around us every day.\\nIf people really are lazy, short-sighted and inattentive, as behavioural economics suggests, then subscriptions are a hugely attractive business model. The subscriptification of everything suggests that businesses have noticed this.\\nThere are some whimsical ideas in behavioural science, and some of them will not stand the test of time. But the central proposition of Nudge is not whimsical: it’s that the default position matters far more than you’d think, not in a laboratory experiment but in markets where billions or trillions are at stake.\\nPeople delegate life-changingly huge decisions — for example, about contributions to their pensions — to the path of least resistance. If behavioural public policy means anything, it means shaping those default positions for the public good. It’s an idea to which I still subscribe.\\nTim Harford’s new book for children, “The Truth Detective” (Wren & Rook), is now available\\nFollow @FTMag to find out about our latest stories first', metadata={'query': 'Changes in consumer behavior regarding streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/b2622d99-4eaf-44f7-bbe2-4b61c716a06b', 'title': 'Netflix and bill — the high price of a subscription lifestyle', 'publication_time': '2023-10-06T04:00:27.860Z'}, uuid=UUID('a0ab7165-fff5-4f8b-96fd-8406e1830502'), db_id=''),\n",

As the largest banking trade association in the US, the American Bankers Association (ABA) is focused on helping lenders of all sizes enhance and expand their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes. Not only is it the right thing to do, it’s good for business.\\nBanks know our industry must continue to adapt because of wider demographic changes and because diverse and inclusive teams are more innovative and agile. They are more likely to remain with an organisation and produce better business outcomes. Banks also understand there is a need to commit to DEI at all levels. Organisations thrive in a culture where everyone feels welcome and respected, regardless of their background.\\nAmong other initiatives, banks are conducting unconscious bias training for staff, launching sponsorship programmes for employees from under-represented groups, and providing resources for inclusive leadership practices.\\nABA works with its members across the $23tn US banking industry to develop and implement tailored training programmes that help bankers learn to mitigate their biases, provide unbiased customer service and leverage the benefits of diverse teams.\\nWe also learn from bankers leading DEI efforts at their own institutions. An advisory group comprising bankers from across the US helps shape our policies and advocacy efforts, to showcase the industry’s dynamic career opportunities and commitment to achieving equitable banking.\\nIn addition, ABA works with other industry groups to facilitate partnerships between mainstream lenders and minority depository institutions to help expand their impact. Minority depository institutions — which are directly or primarily owned by individuals from racially under-represented backgrounds — are an important source of capital for small businesses and under-represented communities across the US. They are key to boosting economic opportunities for many Americans.\\nThrough collaboration, the industry can expand access to banking. In 2019, ABA worked with 21 core providers — those companies responsible for the technology platforms that support the banks’ daily operations — to bolster its Bank On movement. Spearheaded by the non-profit Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, Bank On aims to improve the financial stability of the 5.9mn American households that are unbanked — a situation suffered disproportionately by black, Hispanic or indigenous families.\\nTo be successful, DEI initiatives must be tailored to existing workforces and a bank’s intended culture\\nToday, Bank On-certified low and no-fee accounts are offered at 52 per cent of branches across the US, while institutions with Bank On-certified accounts represent 62 per cent of the domestic deposit market — a significant increase. The unbanked rate has shrunk from 5.4 per cent in 2019 to 4.5 per cent in 2022 — the lowest level since the government started tracking the data in 2009.\\nYet there remains more to do to improve DEI in banking. The data shows that it is still a challenge for women, people of colour, and individuals from other under-represented groups to secure executive roles.

The Financial Conduct Authority looked at it in depth in 2016 and set out ways to lessen the impact on customers.\\xa0But in the face of widespread concern, we decided to revisit the issue.\\nSo far, data from 34 banks, building societies and payment companies does not point to a systemic problem of people being de-banked because of their political views.\\xa0According to that information it has not been the primary driver for any personal account closures.\\xa0We will undertake further checks to be doubly sure and to understand more about what are described as “reputational” factors behind a number of closures.\\nThese may well be legitimate. There are banks who have long declined accounts to businesses that conflict with their company’s policies. But reputational criteria should not be stretched too far.\\nWhat our work has shown is that financial crime and banks’ tolerance for risk are the main causes of closure for actively used accounts.\\xa0That’s why we need an open conversation about getting the balance right.\\nIn the face of rising financial crime, the FCA is working with the government and others to clamp down on the misuse of financial services.\\xa0There is a risk, however, that as parliament introduces measures such as a new offence of failing to prevent fraud, banks err on the side of caution.\\nConversely, we’ve seen innovative payment companies grow fast, as part of the UK’s burgeoning fintech scene, but then retreat and offload customers.\\xa0Do we want to slow that growth or take a bolder approach to risk?\\nOther countries face the same challenge. The US, for instance, has begun a discussion about how to ensure financial crime controls don’t impede access to services.\\nNew powers and technological change may help.\\xa0The UK’s online safety bill will potentially require social media and tech platforms to do more to protect people from scams.\\xa0Would it also be fair for them, like banks, to compensate consumers who have been defrauded?\\nA secure and trusted digital identity, already in use successfully in India and Sweden, is another tool.\\xa0More reliable data and greater proactivity on fraud checks from Companies House, also being debated in parliament, would help.\\xa0And harnessing the power of artificial intelligence could be a game-changer, so long as it doesn’t result in a blanket “computer-says-no” approach.\\nOur report throws up broader questions, too. We will do more, for example, to understand how different customer groups are affected. We are already reviewing the treatment of people who exercise prominent public functions. Expatriate Britons are also significantly affected and do not benefit from the same protections as UK residents.\\nBusinesses, charities and their trustees, and political parties seem more likely to have accounts refused than individuals. But they have no legal right to an account. Only government and parliament can change that.\\nMore than a million people in the UK don’t have a bank account. Since 2016, nine banks and building societies must provide basic accounts. But in other countries access to one is a right, including for businesses.\\nHas a bank account today become more of an essential utility than a commercial service, and if so should it be treated as such? Who should bear the costs if we move to an effective universal service obligation?\\nIf we are to end the phenomenon of debanking then those questions — together with how we balance risk, innovation and commercial freedom — urgently need to be answered.', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/89610303-d115-42d5-b0d2-64dd98e5c4d7', 'title': 'FCA chief: Many questions remain around ‘debanking’', 'publication_time': '2023-09-19T11:06:52.617Z'}, uuid=UUID('de29440d-ce2d-4c34-b6c8-e08c029b2b94'), db_id=''),\n",

But JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon was right to draw attention to credit cards this summer. “We’ve been over-earning in credit for a substantial amount of time now”, he told investors. “We’re quite conscious about it.”\\nDebt is rising. But over the past couple of years, American consumers flush with pandemic stimulus cash have had little difficulty making payments. Credit card delinquencies and charge-offs were abnormally low in the second quarter of the year. This meant that banks such as JPMorgan did not have to set aside the sort of loss reserves that can sting earnings.\\nNow the credit cycle is returning to normal. In August, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s annual report on the finances of American households showed that US credit card balances breached $1tn for the first time in the second quarter of the year. That is 16 per cent higher than last year. It exceeds growth in auto and student debt as well as mortgages.\\nEqually as important, the New York Fed declared that delinquencies — balances more than 30 days late — had jumped back to 2019 levels. Among those with the lowest credit scores, delinquency rates have doubled since the 2021 low point.\\nFor banks, the over-earning that Dimon noted may have already begun to moderate. Rival Bank of America’s credit card delinquency rate of 2.6 per cent is just 40 basis points below 2019 levels.\\nThe question is how softly the US economy can land. According to research from the San Francisco Fed, total “excess savings” for US households peaked at $2.1tn in mid-2021. By March 2023, much of that had gone. Researchers estimated that $500bn remained. There is some hope that this can prevent a sudden cut in spending.\\nEven with this buffer, however, consumers face elevated prices and higher debt servicing costs. Forbearance policies for student loans are at an end. For those carrying credit card balances, the average rate of interest now exceeds 20 per cent, up from mid-teens prior to the pandemic. Elevated carrying costs will soon eat into savings.\\nOur popular newsletter for premium subscribers is published twice weekly. On Wednesday we analyse a hot topic from a world financial centre.

The gender gap in private pensions is currently estimated at about 35 per cent, according to the Department for Work & Pensions.\\n“Defined contribution outcomes are an incredibly direct mirror of the labour market.

In April, the government said it hoped to remedy shortcomings which meant those who opted out of the benefit did not receive the credit.\\nResearch published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think-tank, this year warned women’s contributions dropped significantly after the birth of a first child.\\n“Women are particularly likely to leave work and when they go back it’s generally part time and this has a massive effect on contributions,” said Laurence O’Brien, a research economist at the IFS.\\nThe think-tank said more support was needed for women on maternity leave, including measures to boost child benefits to support parents. It warned that much of the pension difference still hinged on issues in the labour market.\\nWebb said reducing the amount of time women spent out of work was vital. He advocated a combination of improved childcare provision and the implementation of a “use it or lose it” system for parental leave to ensure both parents were evenly sharing leave.\\nThe Department for Work & Pensions said auto enrolment had “brought millions of women into pension saving” and it was working closely with employers to close remaining gaps that might impair women’s retirement.\\nComments have not been enabled for this article.', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/6b125c5c-eb8a-42dd-b721-34923389ae05', 'title': 'Gender pension gap to remain for decades without action', 'publication_time': '2023-09-02T09:01:32.737Z'}, uuid=UUID('5c7f5247-ba53-4db1-89a5-c14c3e95c871'), db_id=''),\n",

Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday\\nGood morning. Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings absolutely demolished Wall Street’s expectations. The company reported $13.5bn in revenue, over $2bn more than the consensus expected and double the year-ago number. It’s targets for next quarter were equally impressive. The stock rose 6.6 per cent in late trading. We’ve compared Nvidia in 2023 to Cisco in 2000 — but back then Cisco was only growing about half as fast. Should we relinquish our scepticism? Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and ethan.wu@ft.com .\\nWe have written a series of newsletters about private credit and whether it can deliver on the promise of equity-like returns without equity-like risk.\\nTalking to people across the industry — direct lenders, managers of business development corporations, and so on — one idea that keeps coming up is that private credit investors are protected by large equity buffers at the company level and by low leverage at the fund level. Lenders into leveraged buyout deals are insulated from losses by the increasingly large equity investments of the PE deal sponsors. And private credit vehicles themselves often contain a big slug of equity. BDCs, for example, generally have debt/equity ratios of just 1 or 1.5. This means credit losses do not have as much potential for destroying value as in more leveraged vehicles (such as banks!).\\nThe basic idea is that there can be a lot of losses before creditors get badly hurt. There is a good deal of truth in this. But it is important to be clear about exactly which creditors are protected, how, and to what degree.\\nHere is Michael Arougheti, chief executive of Ares, back in May (as flagged by Robin Wigglesworth over at Alphaville ):\\nThe big misunderstanding [is that in] the bulk of the private credit markets\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009[loans] are underpinned by cash equity from a sophisticated institutional equity owner and a sophisticated management team, and we are going into this current cycle with more equity subordination in all of these capital structures with better underwriting than we’ve ever seen\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\nThe math would simply tell you that if we’re talking about real losses in the private credit asset class, you will have blown through $2tn to $3tn of institutional equity, but people don’t like to talk about that fact.\\nAlong remarkably similar lines, one executive at a big BDC put this to us:\\nYou cannot run math resulting in a creditor losing a dollar. You’d need a 40 per cent default rate and 40 cent [on the dollar] recoveries to blow through 50 per cent of the capital structure. I understand the point that private credit hasn’t been tested, but [historically normal] 10 per cent default rates and 70 cent recoveries still wouldn’t result in half of the equity getting evaporated.\\nWhat constitutes “real losses”, though? If all the equity has been lost, the company is worth less than the loans against it, and the lenders lose some of their capital. In that specific sense, a bigger equity cheque from the sponsor, and therefore a lower loan-to-value ratio, is indeed a help. And the sponsor cheques have been getting bigger. Buyout loan-to-value ratios have been falling in recent years. Here, from Ares , is what LTVs looked like before the financial crisis and the pandemic:\\nNow, as banks pull back from the syndicated loan market and financing conditions tighten, private credit lenders are able to extract even bigger equity cheques, and lower LTVs. A representative LTV these days looks more like 40 per cent, several people told us.\\nHowever, a company remaining more valuable than its debt does not imply that the debt investors’ investment has retained all its value. Imagine a company that was once worth $100mn, with $50mn in debt (a 50 per cent LTV ratio). If the company is now worth less than $50mn, it is likely facing serious cash flow problems, and is struggling or failing to make its debt payments. What’s more, the lenders are facing the prospect of owning the company, a huge, time-consuming, expensive pain in the ass. They may not be able to realise all of that $50mn by the time the company is sold.\\nRemember, in this connection, that equity layers are not money in the company’s or fund’s bank account. “The equity doesn’t pay debt service. It’s theoretical, not a pile of money there to be resourced,” as Christina Padgett, head of leveraged finance research at Moody’s, puts it. Once the equity is gone, the promise of high-single-digit creditor returns is probably long gone, too.\\nThe big equity cheque from deal sponsors does, on the other hand, signal the depth of those sponsors’ commitment. If a company is struggling with cash flow, its sponsors may provide financing or stump up more equity as part of a refinancing — as they did in the recent case of the fintech company Finastra.\\nBut this is a hope, not a guarantee, and there are misalignments between PE and PC. One senior direct lender notes that while a top PE shop can afford to take heavy losses on, say, a quarter of its portfolio, private credit’s returns are much more dependent on preventing losses. “PE equity cheques don’t keep you safe if you haven’t done good underwriting on your own,” he says.\\nTo get a sense of what full-cycle private credit losses might look like, Padgett and her team look at the history of “distressed exchanges”. These are voluntary debt restructurings to avoid bankruptcy, often by PE-sponsored companies with floating-rate debt (and thus resembling what many direct lenders invest in). Between 1987 and 2019, the average creditor in a distressed exchange recovered a respectable 72 cents on the dollar. But two in five distressed exchanges did not ultimately stop a bankruptcy. In those cases, recovery rates looked much worse; the average creditor lost half of what they put in, with some losing more.\\nThe point is that blowing through half a company’s value in a distress situation is not just possible, it’s relatively common. Just this year, a change to medical billing laws wiped out KKR’s $3.5bn equity investment in bankrupt Envision Healthcare. Senior creditors will probably take losses.\\nZooming out, a lot of people in the private credit industry have told us that the asset class can offer high single- to low-double-digit returns, while offering a risk profile as good as or better than that available in the high-yield bond market. That is to say, the promise is equity-like returns without equity-like risk. The promise rests on two foundations: extra spread on the returns side, and high equity buffers on the risk side.\\nThe extra spread, the industry argues, comes from providing borrowers with certainty, privacy and flexibility that public bond markets cannot. Sceptics argue the spread just comes from taking extra credit risk. We disagree with the sceptics, but expect this spread to diminish over time as more and more capital rushes into the industry. The equity buffer, meanwhile, will indeed help lenders avert wipeout losses. But they will not stop a real credit cycle from eroding the high returns that private credit has enjoyed in recent years. Equity returns without equity risk is a violation of the laws of financial gravity, which come for all asset classes eventually.

In the US, Netflix has told customers that if they want to share their password, they must pay $7.99 a month to add a person outside their home, or $6.99 if they are prepared to have an account with adverts.\\nThat policy appears to be working. In the three months to the end of June, Netflix added 5.9mn subscribers, well above Wall Street expectations for 2mn. “The cancel reaction was low,” the company told investors on Wednesday.\\nHowever, shares in Netflix, which had gained more than 8 per cent in the five days leading up to the earnings release, dropped more than 8 per cent in post-market trading after the company reported softer revenue.\\nNetflix’s quarterly revenue rose to $8.2bn, up 3 per cent from a year ago but just short of forecasts for $8.3bn. The company predicted that revenue would climb to $8.5bn in the current quarter, missing analysts’ forecasts for $8.7bn.\\nNetflix’s password crackdown reflects the harsh realities of the costly streaming model that it has pioneered. When Wall Street was more keen on streaming, investors looked past the heavy losses companies were enduring, so long as they were able to keep adding subscribers quickly.\\nBut as the wider market has cooled, investors are more focused on profits. Competition has heated up, with Disney and others vying with Netflix for customers.\\nRecommended\\nNetflix is profitable, while Disney+, Paramount+ and other rival streaming services are still losing money. Netflix on Wednesday reported quarterly net income of $1.5bn, up 3 per cent from the same period a year ago.\\nThe company said it would spend less money this year due to the historic labour strike in Hollywood, which has brought movie and television production in the US to a halt. Netflix now expects free cash flow of $5bn this year, up from its previous estimate of $3.5bn.\\nMany workers have blamed Netflix for ushering in a streaming revolution that has made it difficult for screenwriters to make a decent living.

Netflix “needs to consider its pricing strategy for the mid to long term”, he said.\\nAfter tumbling last year, Netflix shares have made a comeback in 2023, gaining more than 60 per cent.\\n“While we’ve made steady progress this year, we have more work to do to reaccelerate our growth,” Netflix told shareholders in a letter.', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/fda9fa7b-3a4c-4a16-b384-7867b0974074', 'title': 'Netflix’s password-sharing crackdown pays off with nearly 6mn new subscribers', 'publication_time': '2023-07-19T21:37:20.999Z'}, uuid=UUID('d9975055-4c02-48c6-9d15-3a68fde39297'), db_id=''),\n",

Once those titles were stripped out, the survey showed that only an average 8.1 per cent of women held managerial roles at the regional lenders.\\n“Some of the figures by the regional banks suggest gender-washing,” said Tatsufumi Shibata, deputy director-general at the FSA’s policy and markets bureau and previously the deputy head of its supervision division.\\n“It’s also an issue of double standards,” Shibata said in an interview with the Financial Times. “For example, if the position of assistant section chief is considered a managerial role for a female employee but not for a male employee, that’s problematic.”\\nThe survey also showed a wide gender pay gap at regional banks, especially among employees in their 40s, with male bankers earning an average of ¥8.7mn ($60,300), compared with ¥5.3mn for their female colleagues.\\n“Regional banks are typically viewed as old, traditional Japanese firms with a seniority-based and male-dominated system,” Shibata said, calling for a “transformation” of corporate culture.\\nMisgivings about disclosures from regional banks have emerged only a year after the Japanese government made it mandatory for listed companies to report diversity indicators including their gender pay gap and percentage of female managers.\\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida has set a goal for women to occupy 30 per cent of executive positions at top listed companies by 2030 — a target previous administrations have repeatedly aspired for and missed. On Kishida’s watch, Japan has dropped to 125th in the World Economic Forum’s gender equality ranking, from 116th last year.\\nData from the health ministry shows that about 12 per cent of women held managerial positions at Japanese companies during the 2021-22 financial year.\\nThe increasing scrutiny also comes as companies are under pressure from investors to increase the number of women on their boards . Large asset managers, sovereign wealth funds and proxy advisers have been considering gender diversity in their voting behaviour and recommendations in recent years.\\nAt regional banks, the percentage of female managers also ranged widely, from 1.5 per cent to 51.9 per cent — a discrepancy that Shibata said could be due to the broad definition of management roles under Japanese regulations.\\nRecommended\\nAccording to the health ministry, a female employee can be designated a manager if she holds the title of kacho , or “section chief”, which is defined as an employee in charge of a unit with two or more subsections and who supervises 10 or more employees.\\nBut that definition can be malleable, as the ministry also says a company can categorise a female employee as a manager if she carries out the same duties as other section chiefs, even if she does not hold the title. There is no obligation for companies to define those equivalent responsibilities.\\nThe effect is to expand the pool of women who qualify as managers and inflate the figures for female representation in senior roles that the banks report. Men holding similar roles would not be defined as managers.\\nAmong the regional banks, Niigata-based Daishi Hokuetsu Bank, The Senshu Ikeda Bank in Osaka and The Hyakujushi Bank based in Kagawa prefecture disclosed in June that more than 20 per cent of women occupied management positions, but those numbers included deputy section chiefs or managers.\\nOfficials at the banks said the designation of female managerial roles was in accordance with health ministry rules. “If we restrict female managers to section chiefs, then the number will fall significantly,” said one official at a regional bank.', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/242e0c98-c160-4bf2-9a8a-6c529ce73aae', 'title': 'Japanese banks accused of ‘gender-washing’ over women in management', 'publication_time': '2023-07-12T00:30:30.238Z'}, uuid=UUID('2c3c20d4-f9e3-4916-a783-93ccd4fdb87a'), db_id=''),\n",

Private credit managers provided an estimated $127bn worth of loans in 2021, up 20 per cent on the year before, according to the Alternative Credit Council, which represents businesses in the private credit and direct lending sectors.\\nA move into private credit would be part of the BT scheme’s plan to secure retirement payments through so-called cash-flow matching, an approach that seeks to match expected returns from investments with expected payouts to pensioners in a defined benefit scheme.\\nThe BT pension plan, which closed to new entrants in 2001 and has 275,000 members, is at present paying out about £2.5bn a year to current pensioners.\\n“Our ambition is to build our cash-flow matching portfolio by 2034, which is when all of our members will move from savers to pensioners and be drawing income,” Francis said. “We find that private credit gives us not just the cash flow generation, but there’s also a risk premium in there. That works for us.”\\nTo meet its objective, he said the plan would consider investing in “anything with a contractual income”, such as real estate or bonds, in addition to private credit.\\nHe declined to put a figure on the potential scale of investment in private credit but said it could become “significant” as the fund sold off assets that were not cash-flow matching.\\n“If you assume that we need to be cash-flow matched by 2034\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009. we are around a little bit over 50 per cent of that at the moment,” he said. “But the buildout needs to come over a number of years.”\\nFrancis said the scheme did not intend to become a direct lender, but would invest in private credit funds.\\nRecommended\\nThe BT fund’s strategy comes as other global investors seek to increase their exposure to private debt following the recent upheavals in the banking sector, including the collapse of Signature Bank and First Republic in the US and the sale of Credit Suisse to its Swiss rival UBS this year.\\nCalpers, the biggest public pension plan in the US, said last month that “there are opportunities it could pursue” based on current tightening in the banking industry.\\nThe US Federal Reserve last month warned of a “sharp contraction” in credit. Big private capital companies such as Blackstone, Apollo Global Management and KKR have been exploring ways to increase their exposure to private credit.\\nFrancis stressed, however, that there were “liquidity risks in private credit” for investors.\\n“I think it’s really important for anyone who wants to invest to build a diversified portfolio,” he said. “Diversification is your friend.”', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/d28ce3b9-f830-46a6-9ece-9f5f4e933c56', 'title': 'BT Pension Scheme seeks to invest in private credit sector', 'publication_time': '2023-06-08T04:00:27.473Z'}, uuid=UUID('abff7758-9e00-4b17-8e3e-b84f33cd09d8'), db_id=''),\n",

Both come with generous tax breaks.\\nThe Treasury wants to simplify the schemes with a view to expanding their use among lower earners in particular.\\nMinisters see employee share ownership as a way for employers to motivate and retain staff, while helping workers save and aligning their interests with the company’s.\\nBoth Conservative and Labour politicians have historically favoured employee ownership — viewing it respectively as a route to a share-owning society, or a way for workers to share the wealth they create.\\nVictoria Atkins, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the schemes offered “a boost for business” by giving people an extra stake in what they did, and that making them easy to set up would support the government’s objective of growing the economy.\\nListed companies have made relatively liberal use of a separate scheme, the Company Share Option Plan, which allows them to offer key staff the option to buy shares in the company at a fixed price, free of income tax or national insurance contributions. In April, the government doubled the limit on the maximum value of CSOP options an employee can hold, from £30,000 to £60,000, while relaxing rules on the types of shares eligible.\\nHowever, a smaller and declining number of companies use the SAYE and SIP schemes, designed to offer options or shares to all employees.\\nIndustry representatives have lobbied ministers for reforms they say would boost take-up, in particular reducing the time employees have to hold shares in a SIP in order to qualify for tax breaks, from five to three years.\\n“People with less money have to wait longer for the tax advantage than executives,” said Sarah Anderson, business development manager at RM2, an advisory group, noting that three years was the norm in other schemes.\\nShe added that another potential barrier to take-up was the recent reduction in the tax-free allowance for dividend income, which will drop from £2,000 last year to £500 in 2024-25, meaning many relatively low earners paid dividends through a SIP could be required to fill out a self-assessment tax return.\\nA recent evaluation by HM Revenue & Customs found that awareness of the schemes was low: senior executives of more than half the companies already using them did not even know they were signed up. Some were also worried that employees could gain a controlling interest in the company and about administrative complexity.\\nE arlier research by the Social Market Foundation, published in 2020, found a majority of listed company employees would like to own shares in their employer. However, almost four in 10 of those offered the chance turned it down because they felt they could not afford it.\\nThe Treasury is asking companies and employees what changes would encourage them to participate in the schemes.', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a9972435-d33c-4a6b-bb1c-bb3078918135', 'title': 'UK aims to boost worker share ownership with overhaul of rules', 'publication_time': '2023-06-05T16:02:18.263Z'}, uuid=UUID('116e2585-9798-4a03-8643-6494653cd444'), db_id=''),\n",

The merger is scheduled to complete in July.\\nAs India’s economy has recovered from the pandemic and its population grown to become the world’s largest this year , consumers have borrowed faster than companies in order to buy goods from houses to cars or fund education.\\nDuring March banks increased the amount of personal loans they wrote by 20.6 per cent year on year, compared with 12.6 per cent in the same month a year earlier.\\nThe Reserve Bank of India, which publishes the data, said the jump was “primarily driven by ‘housing loans’”, while lending to industry grew at a more sluggish 5.7 per cent in March, slowing from a 7.5 per cent increase the previous year.\\nMistry said he was unconcerned about the rapid growth in unsecured lending. “Even in unsecured loans there’s not been any real credit issue which has ever cropped up,” he said, arguing that “regulations in India are extremely tight”.\\nRobust house-buying spurred a 21 per cent jump in HDFC’s net profits for the year ending this March, to Rs460bn (about $5.6bn), as development ramps up in India’s smaller towns and cities.\\nIndia still has one of the world’s lowest rates of housing loans to gross domestic product, although that ratio has almost doubled every decade this century — from 3.2 per cent housing loans to GDP in 2001-2, to 10.6 per cent in 2021-22 — according to the National Housing Bank.\\nHowever, rising incomes, relatively stagnant housing prices and government incentives are making house- or apartment-buying a more realistic prospect for many middle class consumers. “Affordability today is a lot better than what it historically has been,” said Mistry.\\nMeanwhile, rising interest rates, which have hurt housing demand in other economies, have barely registered in India where mortgage rates have historically been high.\\n“If 1 per cent goes up to 4 or 5 per cent that’s a massive increase,” said Mistry. “In India, interest rates were always high, so when the rates go up\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009the percentage increase in the interest rate is not that significant.”\\nMortgage interest rates range between 9 and 14 per cent in India, according to non-bank lender Bajaj Finserv.

No one had yet heard of Disney Plus or the streaming wars.\\nBut after the platform lost subscribers early last year, Hastings called time on this breezy attitude towards password sharing, which has given rise to an estimated 100mn Netflix freeloaders around the world.\\nIn recent days, the company has launched password crackdowns in the US, UK and more than 100 other countries. In the US, it has told customers that if they want to share their password, they must pay $7.99 a month to add a person outside their home, or $6.99 if they are prepared to have an account with adverts.\\nThe crackdown plus the new push into advertising reflect the tough realities of the streaming business model that Netflix pioneered. In the boom times, investors were willing to overlook eight- or nine-figure quarterly losses as long as subscription growth was strong. Now, however, new sign-ups have slowed and competition is intense. In the US, the average household has 5.5 streaming subscriptions, notes Jennifer Chan, global strategic director at research group Kantar.\\n“Overall household streaming penetration hasn’t changed very much since the end of Covid,” Chan said. “So the focus for streamers now is on retaining their current customer base and becoming the priority subscription so that consumers aren’t cancelling — and if they are, how do you win them back.”\\nInvestors meanwhile want to see a path to profitability, putting serious pressure on most of the major streaming services to slash costs and come up with new strategies to generate cash.\\nNetflix is profitable, but Disney Plus, Paramount Plus and NBCUniversal’s Peacock are still racking up hefty losses. Warner Bros Discovery, which aggressively cut costs after the companies were combined in a $40bn merger last year,\\xa0recently told investors it expected to turn a profit in its streaming business a full year ahead of schedule and that this part of the business made $50mn in profit in the most recent quarter.\\nLike Netflix, Warner has been making big changes to its streaming service. On Tuesday it\\xa0combined its HBO Max service — home of Succession , White Lotus and Game of Thrones — with Discovery Plus, which specialises in low-cost unscripted programming such as 90-Day Fiancé . The combined service was renamed Max, and the company hopes the broader offering will increase customer numbers and engagement.\\nDisney chief executive Bob Iger plans a similar move later this year by merging child-friendly Disney Plus and Hulu, which focuses on general entertainment aimed at adults, into one app. Iger said this would boost sales of Disney’s with-adverts subscription packages, another step towards reaching its goal of turning a profit in streaming next year. In the meantime he must also address investor worries about subscriber growth — the company’s streaming services have lost customers for the past two quarters.\\nNetflix may face similar problems of retaining customers as it cuts password sharing options. In early trials, Netflix said some users dumped the service, with as many as 1mn cancellations in Spain alone, according to Kantar. While many return — either adding new accounts or opting for the cheaper ad-supported version — there is still some risk, Chan says.\\n“If people are to cancel their subscription, they will be exposed to life without Netflix” and perhaps switch to other services, she said. “I think people will come back, but they may not regain their whole subscriber base.”', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a85f2d38-1889-4108-92af-525ed924b133', 'title': 'Netflix is taking a necessary risk in tackling its 100mn freeloaders', 'publication_time': '2023-05-26T04:00:49.086Z'}, uuid=UUID('3c910191-57fb-4b0a-9f66-bf3579d68484'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nStephen Gandel in New York\\nUS regional banks are rushing to exploit rules that allow depositors to hold tens of millions of dollars in insured accounts, offering security far exceeding government-backed insurance to soothe clients unnerved by the recent banking turmoil.\\nThe move entails the use of reciprocal deposits, which funnel a portion of customer cash to other lenders, keeping the total amount in each account less than the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s $250,000 cap on insurance coverage.\\nDeposits in so-called reciprocal accounts soared to a new record high of $221bn at the end of the first quarter, up from $158bn at the end of 2022, according to government records compiled by BankRegData. The increase was recorded after the March collapse of Silicon Valley Bank , where more than 90 per cent of deposits were not covered by federal insurance.\\nAmong regional banks advertising high-balance insured accounts is PacWest Bancorp , which like the former SVB often lends to start-ups and their investors.\\nBeverly Hills, California-based PacWest’s website says clients can “rest assured” because the bank can offer up to $175mn in insurance coverage per depositor, or 700 times the FDIC cap.\\nShares of PacWest have plunged more than a third since mid-March. The bank said in its most recent financial filing that it was enrolling more of its customers in “reciprocal deposit networks”, over which hundreds, or in some cases thousands, of banks spread customers’ funds in order to stretch insurance limits.\\nThe biggest of these networks is run by IntraFi, a little-known Virginia-based technology group. Founded by three top former bank regulators, it is now owned by private equity giants Blackstone and Warburg Pincus and contains about 3,000 banks.\\nPacWest’s reciprocal deposits rose 60 per cent in the first quarter to $6.7bn and now make up 23 per cent of its overall deposits. The bank recently reported that its percentage of deposits not covered by FDIC insurance had dropped to 25 per cent, down from more than half at the end of 2022.\\n“Banks are using reciprocal deposits aggressively, as they should,” said Christopher McGratty, an analyst who follows regional banks for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. He said that in the wake of SVB’s collapse, investors wanted banks to reduce their use of uninsured deposits. “It’s a bit of window dressing, but it’s legit,” he said.\\nPacWest did not respond to requests for comment, while the FDIC declined to comment. IntraFi said: “Bipartisan laws and regulations have long recognised the value of reciprocal deposits as a stable source of funding that supports local banks and community lending.”\\nThe cap on federal deposit insurance is applied on a per-customer, per-bank basis, meaning wealthy people can still benefit from protection if they spread their money around multiple financial institutions. Reciprocal deposit networks perform the same function automatically.\\nBanks can divert large accounts into the networks, where they are parcelled up into $250,000 chunks and sent off to other FDIC-insured lenders. The networks match up the parcels so that any bank sending a customer’s deposits into the system immediately receives a similarly sized parcel from another bank.\\nCrucially, the networks allow banks to increase their level of insured deposits while giving large customers seamless access to their money. Banks pay the network operators a small management fee.\\nReciprocal deposits still make up just 2 per cent of the $10.4tn in deposits insured by the FDIC. But they made up a notable 15 per cent of the growth in insured deposits in the first quarter. The share of deposits covered by the federal deposit insurance fund was highest in at least a decade at 56 per cent.\\nRegulators have largely blessed banks’ use of reciprocal deposits. In late 2018, Congress changed rules to allow banks to consider most reciprocal deposits the same as any other insured account. This status exempts them from the special levy on uninsured deposits the FDIC has proposed to pay for SVB and other recent bank failures.\\n“Some people have been talking about raising deposit insurance,” said Brian Brooks, a banking lawyer and former board member of the FDIC, who co-authored a recent Wall Street Journal column calling for, among other things, greater use of reciprocal banking networks. “Our point is there’s no need to do something like that because there is already a mechanism for significantly increasing the amount of insured deposits.”\\nOthers have been more sceptical. “To the extent that these deposit exchange programmes help weak banks attract deposits, it creates instability,” said Sheila Bair, who headed the FDIC during the global financial crisis. She has called out the deposit exchanges for “gaming the system”, in the past. “It increases moral hazard. There are many good banks that use these exchanges but the exchanges also allow weak banks to attract large uninsured depositors who wouldn’t otherwise bank with them.”\\nIntraFi is one of the winners of the recent regional banking crisis. Transactions for its main deposit swap business increased in the first three months of the year, said a person close to the company.\\n“Turmoil in the banking sector has been a big driver of the demand,” said Tom Ormseth, an executive vice-president at R&T Deposit Solutions, one of IntraFi’s competitors. “It is going to significantly add to our growth over the long-term.”', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/5ff8b990-ae08-4cd3-976d-d37a9035d38e', 'title': 'US regional banks swap $220bn in deposits to soothe insurance nerves', 'publication_time': '2023-05-24T04:00:03.570Z'}, uuid=UUID('5030d386-ed80-4de7-a82c-02b691f91fdb'), db_id=''),\n",

Household finances have been strong for years after US government took an aggressive response that shielded Americans from the worst impact of Covid-19 lockdowns and left them flush with cash. Now, while companies are still hiring and there are few obvious signs of strain, Americans’ monthly personal savings have started to lag:\\nOn closer look, “middle class balance sheets [now] look weaker than broad metrics suggest,” write Barclays strategists in a recent note.\\nThey continue:\\nAs might be expected, the balance sheets of first\\xa0quintile (highest income) consumers appear to be in great shape. Perhaps less intuitively, we find that the balance sheets of fifth\\xa0quintile consumers (lowest income) are\\xa0also in good shape on a historical basis. Second\\xa0quintile consumer balance sheets appear modestly improved, while third and fourth\\xa0quintile balance sheets appear notably weaker on a historical basis.\\nThat means the lower-middle and, uh, middle-middle classes are getting squeezed.\\nThis matters because the market for bonds backed by consumer loans — credit cards, auto loans and the like — turns on the strength of American borrowers’ finances. If consumers can afford to keep paying their car loans, for example, all of the investors who own auto ABS will keep getting paid in full. If enough of those car borrowers stop paying, it kicks off a complex process that shuts down cash flows to some investors to protect cash flows to others.\\nThose tiers of income make up 37 per cent of outstanding US consumer credit (securitised and not), Barclays finds:\\nThere are also some interesting offsets to the weaker balance sheets of the US’s middle and lower-middle classes:\\nWhile measures of financial assets relative to non-mortgage consumer credit show mixed results across consumer income quintiles, measures of total assets (including real estate) relative to total debt appear historically elevated for\\xa0each income quintile.\\nThis means that 1) homeowners are faring much better than renters across the board\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\n.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009and 2) in an environment of tightening consumer credit availability, elevated inflation, and lower savings rates, we believe middle-class borrowers may turn to home equity as a source of liquidity (pressuring home prices and, thus, a core source of wealth for the middle class)\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\nBroadly, Barclays doesn’t say it expects a wave of consumer-loan defaults any time soon.\\nAnd while they know that middle-class Americans make up a healthy share of borrowers, they can’t say which specific markets face the most risk from a middle-class crunch:\\nUnfortunately, we have not come across robust data sets showing borrower profile by income in securitizations. Accordingly, it is a bit difficult to extrapolate what the weaker middle class borrower means for prime auto vs. subprime auto vs. consumer loan vs. credit card fundamentals, etc .\\u2009.\\u2009. There is a correlation between FICO and income (see chart below), but we find it difficult to extrapolate this into lending segment relative value beyond the fact that we think more experienced lenders will fare better.\\nThis report is intended more to capture the fact that broad metrics of consumer balance sheet strength may not be indicative for every US consumer, and that there is, in fact, balance sheet weakness across some consumer income segments.\\nHere’s that credit-rating chart mentioned by the bank:\\nStill, they argue that the consumer-loan ABS market isn’t pricing in the full risk of the environment.\\nSo while those securities are trading at lower valuations (and higher relative yields) than, say, loans against wireless-service towers or tax liens, Barclays says that investors aren’t compensated for the full extent of the consumer risk. They recommend clients look at other sectors instead:\\nIn terms of ABS relative value, we favor diversifying away from profiles more sensitive to consumer credit performance, and favor investing in less correlated, more esoteric sectors\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009. Within more consumer-credit-sensitive ABS, we favor shorter structures, and lenders with cycle-tested performance history that may be able to more adeptly navigate a strained environment for the middle class consumer.\\nThose “more esoteric” markets mentioned above include those for “structured settlements, digital infrastructure, [and] tax liens”.\\nAnother caveat: even if consumer loans aren’t attractive compared to other ABS, they could easily hold up better than markets like corporate bonds and commercial real estate, Barclays says.\\nFrom Barclays:\\nUnless consumer health meaningfully underperforms expectations vs. other areas (e.g., corporates, CRE, home values, etc…), short, de-leveraging consumer ABS may be a good sector for investors worried about continued spread volatility.\\nThe pressure on home values may be fueled by the middle-class consumer’s struggles, as the bank writes elsewhere in the note:\\nIn the case of home equity and home prices… we recognize that there are many ways to unlock home equity — e.g., cash out refis, HELOCs, outright home sales, etc\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009. In a higher rate environment, HELOCs and cash out refis have become less attractive. Accordingly, if the middle class consumer is under pressure, we think outright home sales may be the primary way of unlocking home equity, and this may pressure home prices .\\nFalling demand for mortgage-backed securities may not help either.', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/5edee36a-b861-4e63-b8f3-44245a731149', 'title': 'The US consumer\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009wins again?', 'publication_time': '2023-04-25T23:14:23.979Z'}, uuid=UUID('d40f828c-3bba-417a-b3fd-73d6e360adef'), db_id=''),\n",

This could also cause engagement with Netflix’s service to shrink “modestly” in the short term, it said, although it expected that would recover over time.\\nDespite the rollout delays, Netflix said it was confident it could hit its full-year targets, adding it was “pleased” with the recent paid-sharing launches.\\nRecommended\\nSpencer Neumann, Netflix chief financial officer, said new ad-supported services were still in “start-up mode”.\\nBut the company said it had not seen many customers ditch their high-priced subscriptions in favour of the cheaper ad-supported options as some had feared.\\nSarandos warned that a potential Hollywood writers’ strike next month\\xa0 would be “devastating” to the creative community and to viewers, but he added that\\xa0Netflix has a strong foundation of international content that would help it weather a strike. “We really don’t want [a strike] to happen,” Sarandos said. “We’re at the [negotiating] table”.\\nNetflix added 1.7mn subscribers around the world in the first quarter, below Wall Street forecasts of 2.3mn.

       "  (Document(text='\\nToby Nangle\\nA number of smart FinSky types got in touch following our recent post on how UK households have become self-funding, meaning interest rates are having increasingly inter-household distributional impacts.\\nWhile that broad thesis remains intact, we made a couple of bold claims along the way. Firstly, we claimed that household deposits have grown to be around the same size as household debt. Second, we claimed that households had become — in aggregate — net recipients of interest.\\nWhile the first claim was uncontroversial and amazing, the second seemed too incredible to be, uh, credible? Sure, we had the charts to prove it — but it turns out that we’d made some assumptions that rendered the claim true only in a fairly narrow sense, and potentially only to national economic accounting fanboys/girls. This follow-up post explores the dank (in the traditional sense) niche of economic accounting that makes the statement possible, because dank niches are fun.\\nIt’s easy to see why people had difficulty with the claim. If households have got £2.1tn of deposits and £2.1tn of debt, the idea that households are making a positive spread implies that someone is paying them a (net) spread. Overwhelmingly, households face banks. And many banks’ entire business model is making sure they get paid a spread, if only to make payroll on the six hundred thousand odd staff they employ.\\nLet’s consider potential explanations.\\nPerhaps banks have done a terrible job at extracting revenues from households? No. The Bank of England reckons that UK bank profitability has been strong and net interest margins consistently positive .\\nPerhaps some other sector of the economy is picking up the bill, and banks are just middlemen making a turn? If so, who would these others be?\\nCandidate number 1: swap counterparties. Given the quantity of mortgage borrowing done at historically low fixed rates (while deposits tend to receive variable), maybe households are reaping the rewards of having (accidentally or otherwise) gone short duration amid one of the worst bond bear markets of all time by initiating mortgage fixes, and it’s really banks’ swap counterparties that funding them? This sounds vaguely credible, and is not immediately easy to disprove.\\nCandidate number 2: taxpayers. Recall that the UK Government is spending around £37bn a year remunerating bank reserves. Those arguing against introducing unremunerated reserve requirements have done so on the basis that this would be a tax on banking (rather than on banks), sucking billions from some mix of depositors, lender and bank profits. Households are depositors and lenders. Maybe household net interest surplus is being funded by the taxpayer? We’re not sure this holds up to scrutiny.\\nOr perhaps we just screwed up our data feeds? Nope. Table 1.7.3 of the ONS’s Blue Book shows Households (S.14) Interest (D.41) Uses ( HACY ) are definitively lower than Resources ( HAXV ). Phew.\\nBut did we really understand what was going on inside those ONS numbers? Several learnèd respondents asked about the choices we made in the treatment of FISIM .\\nSpoiler alert, we did not dwell on choices made around the treatment of FISIM. In fact, we didn’t consciously make choices about how to treat FISIM allocations before comparing household interest (uses and resources). This was a big mistake. Because FISIM choices matter.\\nTranslation, please.\\nFISIM stands for financial intermediation services indirectly measured.\\nAs the ECB 2023 primer on measuring household income explains:\\nFISIM represents the financial intermediation services provided by financial institutions that are not explicitly invoiced but are relevant for the measurement of the output of banks and thus may have an impact on GDP and national income.\\nIn other words, it’s a measure of value attributed by statisticians to services banks and other financial intermediators provide to households in pounds and pence.\\nDigging through the methodology issued by the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010), we can see that FISIM is calculated by taking an estimate of the interbank refinancing rate and applying it first to household deposits, to arrive at a measure of utility that households derive from their savings.\\nWe infer the logic behind this move is that household depositors — if they could be bothered — could choose to receive an interest rate equivalent to the interbank refinancing rate rather than the derisory rate offered by their bank.\\nThe fact that households don’t opt to receive interbank refinancing rate on their deposits, and opt instead to receive their actual deposit rate, means that they must really love paying implicit bank charges. Right? And how much value do households receive from these implicit bank charges? Whatever the implicit bank charge happens to be. Obviously.\\nThe ONS’s Blue Book of national economic accounts’ massive spreadsheet actually lays this all out — if you know where to look. At the macro level, Table 1.7.3 (allocation of primary income account, resources and uses) shows that household interest resources are greater than household interest uses. But 124 spreadsheet tabs later, Table 6.1.3 shows that the summary data used earlier is the sum of cash interest (aka interest) and FISIM adjustments (aka households’ love of banking). Here’s the quarterly chart for interest received, split into these two components:\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nAs you can see, financial institutions are pocketing huge amounts of money UK household depositors really love their financial intermediators.\\nHow about borrowers? They’re the other side of the same coin.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nJust like the calculation around FISIM on deposits, FISIM on loans roughly assumes that the interest rate households could pay is the interbank refinancing rate. The amount they pay above and beyond this is the FISIM component. So while depositors are sort of assumed to pay FISIM out of the interest they could’ve received, borrowers pay interest with hard cash. FISIM is the portion of this hard cash that statisticians reckon they paid for financial services.\\nThe eagle-eyed among you will see that FISIM on loans has been negative for the last six quarters. No — this isn’t a statistician’s guess as to the level of households’ newfound collective disdain towards their lenders. It looks to us like this is the ONS representing those lucky people who locked in fixed rate mortgage deals before interbank refinancing rates moved higher. And as fixed-rate deals roll off (and the yield curve steepens), we’d expect FISIM on loans to turn back positive.\\nTwo questions remain. What does this do to net cash interest paid to/from the household sector? And is all this accounting as stupid as we’ve just made it sound?\\nTaking only the cash components of interest paid and interest received, we can no longer say that UK households are net recipients of interest. We can say that rising rates have improved the household sector’s net cash interest position rather than worsened it, for all the reasons we spoke about in the original post . And that — given the household sector has a comparable quantum of deposits and loans — interest rate changes are increasingly distributional within the sector.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nMoving on to the question about whether all this accounting makes sense in human, despite our flippancy, we sort of think that adding a made-up number to household cash interest received … is not really as stupid as how we’ve portrayed it?\\nThink of it like this. You, a household, have £1,000 on deposit. Your bank pays you an interest rate of 2 per cent per annum despite the interbank refinancing rate being 5 per cent per annum. You also get a debit card, an account that can receive and transmit bank transfers, a network of cash points and a (shrinking) number of physical branches.\\nNational economic accountants record that along with your £20 cash interest you also receive £30 worth of non-cash FISIM. Are your debit card, bank account, etc worth £30 per annum? Cheap at the price!\\nWhat about people who just want the interest and don’t want to pay for FISIM? They could move the entirety of their deposits into short-dated low-coupon gilts and most likely boost their post-tax cash interest substantially. But they’d probably find modern life more challenging.\\nDid we think about this before posting? No.\\nDoes this mean that we’ve accidentally red-pilled ourselves by reading too many national accounting methodology documents? Probably.', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a4312e65-f1f1-4e20-bd29-9f38892bca58', 'title': 'FISIM (with excitement)', 'publication_time': '2024-11-26T13:26:01.708Z'}, uuid=UUID('b0649203-0467-424e-85d7-3766a9fc5984'), db_id=''),\n",

Nearly one in seven women said they would need to continue working past the state pension age of 66 to top up their retirement income.\\nThe impact of the motherhood penalty and the cost of childcare on women’s lifetime earnings remained “the most significant barrier”, said Jackie Leiper, managing director at Scottish Widows. In response, the pensions giant is using an array of digital tools to turn younger female customers on to the benefits of starting pension saving early.\\n“TikTok is where a lot of young people — and young women especially — are getting their financial information,” she said. “Women are really engaged and are keen to learn more about pensions.”\\nFind out more and support the Financial Literacy and Inclusion Campaign\\nScottish Widows launched its own pensions hub on TikTok in September, and video content on pensions and retirement has so far generated more than half a million clicks to its website.\\nIt has combined this with educational content about pensions on its app, which is now used by more than one in 10 of its 4.5mn workplace pension customers. Open Banking technology allows customers to create their own “digital pensions dashboard” on the company’s app, by linking other pension and Isa accounts from other providers. As well as transferring in former workplace pensions , customers can also adjust their level of savings and are prompted to check their state pension forecast.\\nRecommended\\nAlmost two-thirds of female respondents said they had done little or no research about how much they needed to save, but Leiper said these initiatives helped people of all ages to engage with pension saving and think about their “tomorrow money” and retirement goals in the round.\\nThe wider pensions world is also embracing social media to boost people’s pension awareness. Social media megastar Gemma Collins recently fronted the “Pay Your Pension Some Attention” campaign funded by the Association of British Insurers and the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association.\\nOne YouTube ad features Collins in what appears to be a commercial for anti-ageing face cream, before she delivers the killer line: “Sorry hun, but there’s a more important pot to think about — your pension.”\\nData from TikTok shows there was a 300 per cent increase in use of the hashtag #retirementplanning in the first quarter of 2024, compared with a year previously. Video content tagged under this banner has received more than 10mn views this year.\\nLooking back over the past 20 years, Leiper said there had been a “generational shift” in pensions saving following the introduction of automatic enrolment into workplace pensions in 2012, but warned: “On it’s own, it won’t fix this problem.”\\nWomen are over-represented in lower-paid, part time jobs, so many lose out on pension saving as they earn less than the £10,000 earnings trigger for automatic enrolment\\nWomen are over-represented in lower-paid, part time jobs, so many lose out on pension saving as they earn less than the £10,000 earnings trigger for automatic enrolment. Scottish Widows is campaigning for this to be reduced and mandatory contributions raised from the current 8 per cent to 12 per cent, though Leiper accepts that next April’s jump in employer national insurance contributions would push back the timeframes. “We hope that the government’s pension review will create a road map for this, even if changes are not made immediately,” she said.\\nLeiper added that many of the 2mn women unable to afford to retire were likely to be divorcees, noting how pensions are often overlooked in divorce settlements.\\n“Because pension assets are held in individual names, they are often a hidden thing,” she said, believing many women simply might not know the value of their husband’s pot.\\nShe said the “annuity conundrum” was another future problem: “Currently, three-quarters of all annuities are put in single names, even if the person is married,” adding that the higher monthly income on single policies was the likely reason why. “Women left widowed might assume they are going to get their husband’s pension — but many do not.”', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/9a9c145d-1aa6-4bcf-b487-f4a6e9d1db25', 'title': 'Could TikTok, apps and Gemma Collins boost women’s pensions?', 'publication_time': '2024-11-13T00:01:59.698Z'}, uuid=UUID('5bd1244d-fcdb-46b7-9f36-f54089d52fe7'), db_id=''),\n",

So it is unlikely many of them noticed a new rule on Tuesday making it easier to move personal data from one financial company to another — an innovation known as “open banking”. Banks and their lobbyists, though, care deeply.\\nThe idea, which Britain introduced seven years ago, is that lenders must share data with rivals when a customer requests it. This initiative from the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is broadly helpful. Switching banks would become easier. Those with sparse credit records could invoke their transaction history to help get a loan.\\nYet open banking is already turning into open warfare. The Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group, says the CFPB has overstepped its authority . JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US lender, describes the CFPB’s approach as “unconscionable”. The Bank Policy Institute filed a lawsuit challenging the rule within hours of its publication.\\nIt does not help that CFPB head Rohit Chopra is pitching the initiative as a way for dissatisfied consumers to “fire” their banks. But opponents are right that there are wrinkles to be ironed out, such as exactly how the technology will work, and how millions of data transfers will be policed effectively. Lenders are also bristling at the CFPB’s refusal to let them charge fees to offset the cost of complying.\\nIn Britain, open banking, marketed as a boost to competition, brought less teeth-gnashing. But then the US is a different beast. It has more than 4,000 banks, but four — JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup — tower over the rest. JPMorgan’s assets are 3,500 times bigger than the median lender’s, according to Federal Reserve data .\\nIntroduce more market forces, and odd things could happen. Customers might switch from big banks to smaller ones with better rates. They might defect from smaller banks to bigger ones with slicker services. Or they might do nothing. The average customer has been with their bank for 17 years, one survey found.\\nBanks have much to lose if customers get friskier. For example, US institutions collectively have about $4tn in non-interest bearing deposits. Imagine those earned just 1 per cent in interest — a quarter of what banks earn lending to each other overnight — and it would cost lenders $40bn, about a tenth of the industry’s total pre-tax profit, based on data collected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\\nThe furious reaction of banks belies the more likely outcome, resembling what happened in Britain: some service improvements, but no drastic changes in market share. Resorting to the courts suggests banks are not taking any chances. If they get their way, the door to open banking may get unceremoniously slammed shut.\\njohn.foley@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/0197a3af-89ae-49b6-9dd4-55e3e5592fa9', 'title': 'Open banking challenges America’s cozy lenders’ club', 'publication_time': '2024-10-23T09:37:40.012Z'}, uuid=UUID('bbed7ce2-126c-4232-93c2-afef7825b3a9'), db_id=''),\n",

Since the law was passed third-party apps that are linked to an individual’s bank account have proliferated, without clear rules on how information should be best shared.\\nThe information can be shared through an API (application-programming interface) that allows two websites to easily communicate with each other. But “screen scraping” — where consumers share their bank log-in details for bots to copy their financial information, a practice that regulators have taken a dim view of — is also still used in the US.\\nThe CFPB’s rules will compel banks to put in place systems that will facilitate consumer access to their financial data such as transaction history, account balances and payments details. The CFPB said it was requiring this data be made available for free, and that it hoped these rules would deter the use of screen scraping.\\nThe issue of whether banks could charge a fee to third parties for data sharing had been an area of contention. Banking lobbyists had argued that banks should have the option to charge a fee given the costs of building systems to facilitate the data sharing.\\nRecommended\\nOne aim for the rules is to make it easier for customers to use third-party apps and also stimulate more competition among banks.

While some will have the chance to rest their fingers on the luxurious fabrics within private banks’ waiting rooms, not many qualify for the highest level of service offered.\\nWealthy customers of these institutions may well wonder what the price of admission is into this select group enjoying bespoke private banking, a suite of highly personal services tailored to the needs of individual clients.\\nSome of the most well-heeled clients will ask what they get for their 1-2 per cent fees on their assets, before any additional costs for third party investment funds or services from specialist consultants.\\nChoosing a private bank or wealth manager that matches your needs requires some homework, with services varying between providers. At its best, a team of advisers covers a wealthy client’s needs across investments, tax affairs, philanthropy, even family governance.\\nTypically, the bigger the family pile the bigger the expectations on private banking firms. A family with investable assets of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars and more may have requirements spanning multiple jurisdictions. In some cases they will want someone on the team to answer a question or a request for a meeting on a 24/7 basis. Other clients prefer to be left alone, with only occasional contact. The point is, it’s the client’s choice.\\nBankers will break down their potential market of clients into tiers of wealth. Start with the sub-high net worth category, those with investable assets between $300,000 and $5mn (£230,000-£3.85mn). Ascend to the next level and one meets those with net assets between $5mn and up to $50mn. Finally there is the wealthiest group, those with investable assets above $50mn and all the way into the billions.\\nGaining entry to the select club at the top is another story. This group at the top of the pyramid accounts for about 1 per cent of the global wealthy, about 220,000 individuals. The mid-tier high net worths account for just over 9 per cent. The other 90 per cent are mostly the “millionaires next door”, as consultant Capgemini has tagged them.\\nThe assets of the super wealthy, according to the financial industry experts at Oliver Wyman, total some $56tn as of 2023. These should rise to $82tn by 2028.\\nPlenty of banks and wealth managers seek out the wealthiest families . Yet the premium services offered may involve less luxurious aspects, perhaps just the basics of management. Most bankers will say that the biggest shift for their business in the past decade has been coping with the generational shifts in service expectations among these clients and their families.\\n“Earlier in my career, it was more about the mechanics of transferring [the wealth],” says Stacy Mullaney, head of family offices at Goldman Sachs.\\nToday, she notes: “Clients want much more than just investment management, they want more complex services.” These include not only help with their philanthropic needs, but also planning around family governance, stewardship and conflict management.\\nMullaney’s team offers umbrella services for families who might want to wrap up their wealth in a family office structure, but perhaps cannot afford the expense and management time for such a structure.\\nWealthy families often spread themselves across multiple legal jurisdictions on tax and regulations. Even getting families to meet in one place can require some work, never mind agreeing on a business agenda.\\n“Once you have a family asset which cannot be put on one page, you need to consolidate,” points out Iain Tait, Head of the Private Investment Office at wealth manager London & Capital. “To consolidate the reporting system in a way that the family can understand, succinctly, is difficult.”\\nAnother plus that a more bespoke wealth and banking service can offer is access to the experience and knowledge of other wealthy families. “What do they [other families] do differently?” is a question that will come up, according to Priyanka Hindocha, partner and UK head of the family office at Stonehage Fleming.\\nThe group has form with family offices. A merged entity between two multi-family offices South African Stonehage and Fleming Family & partners of the UK, the wealth adviser has a large minority investment (36.7 per cent) from Caledonia Investments, an investment trust backed by Britain’s Cayzer family.\\nAs such, just bringing the family offices — private investment organisations serving the needs of one or more families — under one structure can save money and add scale. The latter makes a difference for those super-wealthy clients keen on maximising the investment opportunities available to them — in public or private markets.\\nStonehage Fleming’s client base spans the globe, but a substantial proportion are resident in the UK. Ahead of the Labour government’s maiden Budget on October 30, there is concern from clients about any changes in tax rules.\\n“It’s a regular topic of conversation in meetings, with some clients considering moving, and evaluating potential alternative jurisdictions, and certain families and individuals having already left,” worries Anton Sternberg, UK chair at Stonehage Fleming.\\nHow do the banks’ services differ? “ All these wealth services will look similar on [their] web pages,” points out Honora Ducatillon, head of family advisory at Pictet Wealth Management. “It’s more about the how, than the what.” She sees more entrepreneurs selling their businesses, and their families coming to Pictet before the event.\\nPictet, as does Stonehage Fleming, will put dedicated teams to work with these wealthy investors. These advisers will not only cover investment management but also the corporate finance, tax and legal aspects for any sale of the family business. This more personalised service extends to organising all the family governance meetings as well as specialised education seminars on topics including the latest geopolitical situation.\\nJust as important for some clients is the structured lending on offer from banks to the owners of these businesses. Regardless of what the client’s verifiable net wealth may be, much of that may be wrapped up in their business. Thus the super-wealthy client may be asset rich, but cash poor. They could need the services of a full bank.\\nThis would include HSBC Private Bank, which can offer full multi-currency banking and custodian services, but also specialist lending to enable the entrepreneur to extract part of their wealth without losing control of the company. Asian families in particular will have business and familial needs that span the globe.\\nIn Asia, single family offices are less common than in North America and Europe. About 5 per cent of Asian super-wealthy families use such structures, according to McKinsey. That is less than a third of the proportion of those seen in the West.\\n“Our ultra high net worth clients want a one-stop shop. They want to reach us 24/7 to deal with any issue anywhere,” says Lok Yim, regional head of global private banking, Asia Pacific at HSBC. In this case it’s not just about banking functions, but the so-called concierge services.\\n“We can solve problems ranging from concierge services for restaurant reservations to co-investing in private markets,” he added.\\n“We help clients connect. [At the Hong Kong] Rugby Sevens we offer a dinner to meet fellow billionaires for networking. [We also] took a group of Asian clients to San Francisco to meet Silicon Valley companies.”\\nAnother special service that the wealthiest clients can expect is help with giving away their money to worthy causes and non-profit enterprises. For larger donations, it takes money and a lot of effort to give wealth away.\\nOil baron John D Rockefeller learned his lesson the hard way. He noted in an early memoir: “About the year 1890 I was still following the haphazard fashion of giving here and there as appeals presented themselves. I investigated as I could, and worked myself almost to a nervous breakdown.”\\nToday there are many intermediaries keen to help with the philanthropic goals of wealthy families. This might involve anything from researching specific charities to organising the giving itself.\\nTo help with this Lombard Odier created Philanthropia , a private, not-for-profit, Swiss foundation. This is wholly owned by Lombard Odier. Clients are happy to use an existing structure which can keep costs down, the banking group says. It charges an administrative fee, a fraction of the typical cost to create a separate foundation. Philanthropia can help share and reduce the overheads.\\n“Sometimes the client doesn’t know what area or charity to support and this foundation can provide a solution,” notes Frédéric Rochat, managing partner at Lombard Odier. Rochat believes that Lombard Odier’s smaller size and specialisation in both philanthropy and especially asset management provide unique selling points.\\nPhilanthropy offers another, more important, benefit. The family can focus on the charitable project together. It varies from family to family as to whether the elders or the younger generations push to use their money for good. “It’s about the intra-family values and the relationship with the estate,” thinks Rochat. “Some families simply want to see the capital invested as profitability as possible”.\\nWhat won’t private banks do for you? Even those clients with plenty of money may struggle to get the service they need from just one adviser. Not every private bank or wealth manager can cover every need for the wealthy. Some have decided to avoid those areas in which they have less expertise.\\nTait at London and Capital emphasises that his institution is not a bank. Rochat at Lombard Odier prefers to highlight its investment management expertise. Stonehage Fleming staffers and Pictet will put the specialised teams mentioned earlier on to their highest value clients.\\nOne managing partner and chief executive at a Canadian private capital investment firm says he cannot get what he needs from his advisers. “If you have the proper money you’ll get great all-round service. You’ll get attention and something that is well-thought out,” he says.\\nBut he complains that even the best wealth managers cannot show him deal opportunities in which he would like to invest. Others provide the deals but only an off-the-shelf standard of investment products that are not tailored to his needs. In sum, he finds he must mix advisers to get both the deal access and corporate banking he feels he needs with more bespoke advice on his investment portfolio.\\n“The right arm might be like Charles Atlas, but the left is withered,” he says.\\nSome may question whether all this effort from both sides is worth the trouble. For advisers this is a highly competitive segment. However, the total revenues available to bespoke wealth advisers chasing the ultra-wealthy segment are enormous and growing.\\nClient revenues from the wealthiest group are the fastest growing portion of the advisory market. These should climb 39 per cent in the five years to 2028 to $99bn, according to Oliver Wyman estimates. By that point such clients should account for more than a third of all wealth assets worldwide and a healthy 15 per cent of the related income.\\nBut do the wealthy need all this attention and service? Probably. A multigenerational family structure will multiply the number of stakeholders with a call on the original source of the wealth. That requires some paid, external professional management and advisers. Even John D Rockefeller had to call in help.\\nIn such a competitive market, advisers will do their best to maintain the closest ties possible to these individuals and their families, but within reason and the bounds of profitability.

But, after 20 years of wedded bliss, my husband and I still haven’t done any merging of our finances, apart from the mortgage.\\nWe’ve toddled along quite nicely, keeping our banking, savings and investments separate.\\nIt’s pleasing to know this is commonplace. Malvee Vaja, an adviser with Rathbones Financial Planning, says: “Increasingly, as more and more women are taking on better-paid and senior positions, we see clients keeping their finances separate; whether married or not.”\\nNevertheless, I’ve found myself occasionally wondering if our reluctance to have a joint bank account is a reflection on the quality of our relationship.\\nPractically, we would both have complete oversight over household budgets. However, a joint account can spark arguments over spending (clothes for me, gadgets for him).\\nSarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “It can work well for couples where one earns the lion’s share of the income and the other doesn’t want to have to ask for every penny they spend.”\\nRecommended\\nI comfort myself that from time to time, we’ve earmarked separate savings accounts for a joint project, without any needless complications.\\nAdvisers encourage couples to take a “holistic” approach to planning. But could taking out joint financial policies in fact cause more problems than they solve?\\nUnless you share the same approach to money and trust one another implicitly, joint accounts can result in some unwelcome surprises. One partner might spend more than both have agreed and even run up joint debts.\\nHowever, some tax rules favour separate accounts. Taxable investment accounts, called general investment accounts, can be set up jointly, saving on transaction and platform costs. But if you’re wealthy enough to contribute to these above your annual Isa and pension allowances, advisers say it may be wiser to have single accounts. This can be beneficial when it comes to inheritance tax planning, where you leave money into certain types of trust for your spouse on death. If you have a joint GIA this wouldn’t be an option.\\nAdvisers also caution against buying joint life and critical illness insurance, where reduced costs do not necessarily mean “value”. Some are even calling for the protection industry to phase out joint cover.\\nJoint life insurance can either pay out on the first death, which leaves the survivor with no cover, or the second death, with no payout on the first — which is why it tends to be used largely to cover inheritance tax.\\nTwo single policies would pay in both instances. For instance, parents with single critical illness policies may get two payouts for a child that is rushed to hospital with a serious condition.\\nAlan Lakey, director of comparison website CIExpert.uk , says: “If you look at gender-specific claims statistics, most female claims are for cancer and very few for heart attacks. With men it’s the other way around.” His preference is to seek the best cover for the illnesses that each spouse is most likely to suffer.\\nSingle policies are sensible future-proofing, he adds, noting that more than half of marriages result in divorce. They are also good protection against marital economic abuse. Coles says: “There was one notable case where someone had suffered an illness, and had been due a payout, but because both partners needed to agree to the payment, the estranged partner refused it.”\\nThe cost-cutting argument for joint policies ultimately depends on age and health of the two people and the level of cover. But it should hardly be a key factor behind a decision, since the difference in costs is usually minor. Lakey says: “It could be two single plans for £50 a month each or one joint plan for £96.”\\nLike many couples, my husband has his pensions and Isas, I have mine and we have a rough idea of what combined income we expect in retirement.\\nCouples who both earn might want to prioritise the pension of the higher earner, for greater income tax relief on contributions\\nWhile all couples have to follow the tax rules, tax planning leaves them room for choice — and sometimes big savings, if they are prepared to transfer money between them.\\nOpportunity would be knocking harder if one of us was not working. The earner could potentially fill an extra Isa allowance, capital gains tax zero-rated allowance and pension allowance.\\nCurrent rules allow for up to £2,880 per year to be paid into the pension of a non-earning person. Tax relief tops up the amount to £3,600. But research from Nucleus, the adviser platform group, found 76 per cent of people are unaware of this.\\nMaxing out two pensions to get two pension tax-free lump sums also looks increasingly valuable. Speculation over upcoming Budget changes has included the possibility that chancellor Rachel Reeves will cut the maximum tax-free amount from £268,275 to £100,000.\\nOn the other hand, couples who both earn might want to prioritise the pension of the higher earner, for greater income tax relief on contributions. But Gary Smith, partner in financial planning at Evelyn Partners, warns that pensions can be included in a financial assessment for long-term care fees. “The long-term care assessment is done on an individual’s assets and income. So, if assets are predominantly in one person’s name, it leaves the other potentially vulnerable.”\\nSo injecting romance by shared tax planning is not always advisable. But there could still be some limited romance to be had with joint policies in later life.\\nIndependent annuity expert William Burrows says: “When people first retire they want drawdown. As they get older they want guaranteed income. I meet a lot of men who say ‘when I’ve gone I want to leave my affairs tidy and my wife in the same position’. That usually means an annuity.”\\nA single life annuity typically pays a higher annual pension than a joint life product, because income stops on the death of the policyholder. If you both have decent pensions, two single life annuities will pay more from day one.\\nWith a joint annuity, income will continue to the second person for the rest of their life. Income can continue at the full amount, or reduce to two-thirds or 50 per cent.\\nAnd here comes the potential “romance”. Burrows says some people may start off wanting a single life annuity, only to change to a joint product when they realise the reduction in income is not as great as they first thought.\\nA 65-year-old purchasing a £100,000 annuity can get £7,100 a year gross for a single life annuity with level payments (ones that don’t rise during the policy). This will fall to £6,635 for joint life with a 50 per cent continuation of the income after the first death, in cases where the partner is three years younger, Burrows says.\\nSacrificing a few hundred pounds a year so we leave our partner with half our income to enjoy after we die? I guess my husband and I will just have to find out how romantic we feel in another 20 years.\\nMoira O’Neill is a freelance money and investment writer.

       "  (Document(text=\"\\nMeredith Whitney\\nThe writer is chief executive of Meredith Whitney Advisory Group\\nWatchers of the American economy are likely to get confirmation next week of what many of us know anecdotally to be true: well over 50 per cent of US households have been worse off over the past year than they were four years ago.\\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its Annual Consumer Expenditure Survey, and I estimate that it will show the 2023 after-tax income for over 50 per cent of US households, not only below 2022 levels, but below 2021 and 2020 levels as well.\\nOver the past two months, companies from Dollar General and Dollar Tree to McDonald's have spoken about a weakened US consumer. Dollar General stated that their consumers were “cash strapped” and “worse off than they were six months ago.\\nI believe the underlying data may be even worse than it appears. The fact is that 2023 will be the first fiscal year of data without any consumer Covid stimulus subsidies.\\nThe year 2021 was the only one of the past four to reflect 12 months of such stimulus. Both 2020 and 2022 only reflected 6 months of support.\\nPre-tax incomes for households earning less than $70,000 a year moved very little over the past four years, but after-tax incomes, benefiting directly from tax-free Covid stimulus subsidies, increased between 8 and 28 per cent between fiscal 2019 and 2021.\\nWhen the BLS survey data was released last year, it showed only modest year-over-year declines in after-tax income for these same households, barely 2 per cent.\\nHowever, when the new data is released, I believe the year-over-year declines will be more severe, particularly compared with 2021 data. It will become increasingly clear why companies like Dollar General saw such meaningful changes in customers over the past six months.\\nThe obvious question then is why the US economy is still so strong? I believe the strength is due to two specific groups driving consumer spending: the top-earning households and a uniquely subsidised group.\\nAmerican Express data shows Generation Z and millennials spending at a rate of five times those of baby boomers. They have the wherewithal to spend on things like French-press coffee, Instagrammable leisure experiences, online gaming and sports betting as well as yes, avocado toast.\\nFirst, the top-earning households saw next to no impact from the Covid stimulus subsidies. For households earning over $100,000, while pre-tax earnings dipped modestly for the top earners, after-tax earnings stayed relatively constant between 2019 and 2022.\\nHouseholds earning over $150,000 a year represent 17.5 per cent of all households in the US. Their spending has remained constant, even if it has shifted from discretionary items to essentials over the past year.\\nThe generation aged between 24 and 38 represents 20 per cent of the US population and has the most discretionary spending power of any other age cohort. They have and continue to benefit from a different type of subsidy: their parents.\\nThe spending power of the this generation should not be underestimated. They are driving spending in some of the fastest-growing categories of discretionary spending.\\nMany don’t own homes, more live at home with their parents than at any time on modern record, and over half still remain on their parents’ cell phone plans, and other shared cloud services, among other parent-subsidised expenses.\\nEach of these contributes to a large arsenal of spending power. For example, for most households, housing-related expenses (rent equivalent, insurance, property taxes, utilities, and other home-related expenses) represent their single largest expense.\\nHowever, nearly 20 per cent of men and nearly 12 per cent of women aged 24-35 still live at home with their parents and likely pay very little of these expenses.\\nAs long as these trends continue, this age cohort will remain the key driver of discretionary spending in the US. It’s no wonder why there is so much debate over the real state of the US economy.\\nFor over half of the country, I expect the coming BLS survey will show after-tax incomes are down while prices are up, making living standards feel undeniably worse off.\\nHowever, for a smaller group yet a critical driver of consumer spending, very little has changed for them economically. Their subsidies continue.\", metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/ef573c85-bb31-4f1b-88e6-553130ff3245', 'title': 'The generation helping to prop up the US economy', 'publication_time': '2024-09-16T04:00:11.519Z'}, uuid=UUID('9fa15b61-4f58-45d2-8092-8a7fd93cf3f4'), db_id=''),\n",

However, some minority groups are among the highest paid cohorts, including people of Chinese and white Irish ethnicity.\\nPay gap data shows the disparity in average earnings between groups of workers, which can reflect factors such as the relative seniority of different groups, even where there is no direct pay discrimination between people doing the same job.\\nAs with gender pay gap reporting, employers may face pressure to identify and eliminate causes of large disparities. Labour has also promised to introduce disability pay gap reporting.\\nComparing data across companies is complicated by the fact that there is not yet a standardised format for reporting ethnicity pay gaps, something new regulations would address. The government has yet to set out detailed proposals or a timeline for introducing the new requirements.\\nChange the Race Ratio said its members that report the gap show a 10 per cent difference between white and non-white staff, with white staff paid more, though this is lower than the 12 per cent reported in 2022.\\nWhile there are roughly equal numbers of men and women in the population, ethnic minorities account for only 18.3 per cent of the population of England and Wales, according to 2021 census data.\\nRecommended\\nExperts have noted that this could result in the data at individual employers being quite volatile from year-to-year, as a relatively small number of new hires, departures or promotions could have a significant effect on the average pay of a minority group.\\nEmployment lawyers have warned that ethnicity pay gap reporting would be a compliance burden for companies and could fuel more discrimination claims.\\nThe UK’s Financial Conduct Authority faced a backlash from industry last year when it proposed introducing mandatory disclosure of diversity data in areas such as age, sexual orientation, ethnicity and religion. Companies’ concerns included legal challenges with compelling staff to disclose data about themselves in cases where they do not wish to do so.\\nThe government said: “We are determined to root out racial inequalities and address disparities, including through our draft equality (race and disability) bill, announced in the King’s Speech, which will introduce mandatory ethnicity and disability pay gap reporting for large employers.”', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/cab78bac-b859-4dc2-9808-87cb0474fcfa', 'title': 'BT and Aviva back UK plan to report ethnicity pay gap', 'publication_time': '2024-09-07T04:00:55.901Z'}, uuid=UUID('26759185-0149-45fe-8d5a-a64f8c374487'), db_id=''),\n",

A group of retired partners, including three former chief executives, are negotiating with the current leadership to try to get a better deal.\\nGrant Thornton is the seventh-largest accounting firm in the US with $2.4bn in annual revenue. The sale of a majority stake to New Mountain represents the biggest private equity deal in the sector. Advocates say private equity can bring more efficiency to the profession and access to capital for critical investment, but the financial terms of such deals can prove controversial. Retirees are typically among the firms’ largest creditors but do not have a vote on the sale of the firm.\\nGrant Thornton has not publicly disclosed how much New Mountain is paying for its stake, or how exactly the firm will distribute the proceeds of the investment and the new debt that it will also take on. As well as paying off obligations to retirees, the new structure involves repaying capital to current and former partners.\\nPeople familiar with the retirees’ dispute said it centred on a discount rate being used to calculate the lifetime value of the partners’ retirement benefit. Some retirees also argued that mortality assumptions had been picked to lowball the buyout offer. In addition, there are negative tax implications from getting the benefit in one lump sum, the retirees have said.\\nRecommended\\nOne person said there was a lack of trust between the former partners and members of the current leadership team, and “this is not the Grant Thornton that we were hired into”.\\nA Grant Thornton spokesperson said the firm “deeply values the contributions of our retired partners. We have been speaking with them and look forward to addressing any questions they may have.”\\nA dozen former partners, including ex-chief executives Brad Preber, Ed Nusbaum and Mike McGuire, have formed a group to “act as a point of contact” with the firm, according to an email it sent to retirees this week.\\nThe group spoke to current chief executive Seth Siegel on Tuesday “to outline the serious concerns we have heard from you regarding the payment of our retirement benefit”, according to the email, which added: “While we continue to explore other options, we will wait for Seth and his leadership team’s response before further reaction.”', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/46ad8568-6bcd-42e2-86de-a192fefd25a8', 'title': 'Grant Thornton’s retired US partners demand bigger payout from private equity sale', 'publication_time': '2024-03-29T11:00:18.945Z'}, uuid=UUID('684ba086-a4a7-45af-adba-f63e10c0147c'), db_id=''),\n",

Regulators want to cap the late fees that large card issuers can charge to $8 — less than a third of their current levels. Yet you wouldn’t know it from the share prices of the card companies.\\nAmerican Express shares are close to record highs, up 40 per cent over the past year. Synchrony Financial, which provides cards for stores such as JC Penney and American Eagle Outfitters, has gained 45 per cent. Capital One Financial, which is buying rival Discover Financial Services, is up 50 per cent.\\nAmericans held more than $1.1tn on their credit cards at the end of 2023, an all-time high. Nearly 10 per cent of this balance was in serious delinquency (defined as 90 days or more late), according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\\nMore alarming is the rate at which people are becoming seriously delinquent. This surged to 6.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, up from just over 4 per cent at the end of 2022 and the highest level in more than a decade.\\nThe stress is most acute for younger borrowers and those with poor credit scores. Amex, with wealthier borrowers, reported one of the lowest 30-plus-day delinquency rate among the six major US card issuers during the fourth quarter, at 1.3 per cent. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America were at 2.1 per cent and 2.3 per cent. At Capital One and Discover this was nearly 4 per cent.\\nCutting late fees also won’t affect companies equally. These revenues grew to more than $14bn in 2022 of the $130bn issuers charged consumers in interest and fees, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\\nSmaller, standalone credit card companies such as Bread Financial look most vulnerable, suggests S&P Global. Subprime borrowers account for about 43 per cent of Bread’s balances last year. The cap could reduce its revenue by about 25 per cent.\\nBut Synchrony is also exposed, with late fees responsible for nearly a fifth of its operating revenue in 2023. Nonprime borrowers account for about 28 per cent of its credit card balances. Its partner agreements with retailers means some of the impact from loss of late fees will be shared.\\nCredit card companies are high-margin businesses, with returns on equity far above those elsewhere in the banking sector. Amex reported a 33 per cent fourth-quarter return on average common equity. In the coming storm, not everyone will get a soaking.\\npan.yuk@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/4f7c103d-c05f-4550-ae55-87640986ad5a', 'title': 'Why US credit card investors are shrugging off surging delinquencies', 'publication_time': '2024-03-18T13:37:10.926Z'}, uuid=UUID('a864a5ca-e1fe-48fb-ab2a-c58d723e63b4'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nLucy Warwick-Ching\\nI’m moving in with my partner for the first time and we plan to set up a joint account for practical reasons. Am I exposing myself to any risk financially? I’m concerned about sharing my money with someone else.\\nSarah Jane Boon, partner at Charles Russell Speechlys, says that while opening a joint account with your partner is a significant step in your financial journey together, it’s also sensible to be aware of the potential risks.\\nGenerally, when couples move in together two lives begin to merge, and each partner naturally becomes more involved in the other’s schedules, decisions and finances.\\nManaging finances together can also allow for better budgeting, as you and your partner track your expenses collectively and work together to establish realistic budgets that match your shared goals. Consolidating finances can streamline bill payments, savings and other financial responsibilities.\\nOf course, if you plan to have children or purchase a property together, joint accounts become even more of an inevitability due to shared outgoings and often a desire for greater visibility of your household’s overall financial position.\\nHowever, there are several issues to consider, which may not be immediately obvious. Joint accounts can expose both parties named on the account to potential financial risks, including liabilities from overdrafts, debts or associated legal issues. In the event of a break-up or divorce, dividing assets held in joint accounts can be complex and contentious.\\nWhat many don’t realise is that, legally, all money held in a joint bank account is owned by anyone named as an account holder. In most cases, withdrawals from the account only require one person’s authorisation and a party is not limited only to withdraw “their half” of a jointly held balance.\\nThis means it is entirely legal for one person to take money from the account without the other knowing, which can lead to significant disputes for couples going through divorce or separating (who often assume the balance held in the account will automatically be shared equally).\\nWith joint ownership comes shared responsibility for the account. If one partner overspends or mismanages funds, it can affect both individuals’ credit scores and financial wellbeing.\\nThat’s not to say that joint accounts are a bad thing. In the majority of cases, they are useful and practical and, when opened with a trusted partner or family member, can bring many saving and spending benefits.\\nBut before taking this step with your partner, you should engage in open and honest discussions about your financial values, goals and concerns.\\nMy wealthy aunt died recently at her home in London, leaving property assets there and in Switzerland, plus bank accounts, various overseas trusts and share portfolios. Her former nurse has produced the latest copy of my aunt’s will, of which she is a beneficiary to a larger extent than the family realised. We are concerned about the possibility it was changed recently due to malign influence. What should we do?\\nLaura Phillips, legal director at law firm Kingsley Napley , says a good first step would be to investigate the preparation and execution of your aunt’s will. For example, try to find out if it was prepared by a solicitor or will writer (the information would usually be found somewhere on the will). If so, try to obtain the will file containing attendance notes or instructions as to why your aunt made the decisions and legacies that she did.\\nThis may also show whether the nurse was present when instructions were given. If the will is homemade — for example, if no independent person was instructed to assist — try to gather information about your aunt’s demeanour and health when the will was made.\\nIf you have suspicions about the nurse’s influence over your aunt, there are several ways a will could be challenged in England and Wales. The rules are different in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Depending on the evidence, it is possible to bring claims for more than one of these types of issues.\\nThe first consideration is whether your aunt was suffering from a condition affecting her mental capacity, such as dementia. To make a will, a person must have capacity. Even if someone has a diagnosis of cognitive illness, however, this does not automatically mean they lack testamentary capacity. It will require a detailed review of the medical evidence and other contemporaneous documents to assess this.\\nIt is also possible that, even if your aunt did not suffer from such a condition, she may not have known and approved the entire contents of her will. For a will to be valid, the testator must be aware of its contents including all the details, however complex, and whichever gifts are specified.\\nI am going through the process of divorcing my husband and have found out he’s borrowed money, unbeknown to me, from his parents, to help pay our mortgage for the past few months due to our rate going up significantly. I thought our finances were relatively simple, but these soft loans have thrown our divorce agreement in a spin — am I liable to help pay back his parents, even though I had no knowledge of these loans?\\nFinally, you should consider whether your aunt may have been unduly influenced or coerced by her nurse. Undue influence claims are quite often pleaded but are very difficult to prove because the person who could give evidence that they were being coerced is deceased. However, contemporaneous documents such as medical records, diary entries, and the recollections of other people who were close to your aunt and may have had suspicions can be considered.\\nThe assets held in overseas trusts will not pass under your aunt’s will so you would need to consider the trust documents or contact the trustees to establish who are the beneficiaries of any trust assets following her death.\\nGiven your aunt also had assets in Switzerland, you should also obtain advice from a lawyer there to establish how the will (and any challenge to its validity) would be treated under Swiss law.\\nThe opinions in this column are intended for general information purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional advice.

Men have £1.01tn invested versus £450bn for women. The figures include personal investments but exclude workplace pensions.\\nThe difference has grown due to more men between the ages of 25 and 44 putting their money to work for the first time compared with women in the same age bracket, according to the study, which questioned 6,486 adults across the UK. Young women also tend to be more risk-averse and less confident about investing than their male counterparts.\\n“The gender investment gap remains stubbornly and frustratingly high and has got worse in 2024,” said Holly Mackay, Boring Money’s chief executive. “Shockingly, it’s higher than the gross domestic product of Poland or Argentina.”\\nJust 19 per cent of women aged 25 to 44 were investors in January 2024, up 1 percentage point from the previous year. Meanwhile, the proportion of British men of the same age who had invested rose from 28 per cent to 34 per cent.\\nThe gap is even more pronounced for 18 to 24-year-olds, where 9 per cent of women invest compared with 22 per cent of men.\\nIn Scotland and Wales, men under 44 are three times more likely to invest than women.\\nThe average amount held by male investors is £102,000, compared with £66,000 for women. If invested amounts by gender were spread across all men in the UK, men would have on average £40,000, while women would have £16,000.\\nThe survey also highlighted disparate attitudes to risk, with women of all ages — even those who invest — less tolerant of it than men. Only 18 per cent of women would choose a higher-risk pension in comparison with 33 per cent of men.\\nMen’s preference to invest in cryptocurrencies may also contribute to the gap.

Lenders were asked in December by the Treasury committee to state how many SME accounts they hold, the number of closures in the past year and the reasons behind them.\\nThe figures are based on the responses it received from the big four UK high street banks — Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and NatWest — as well as Handelsbanken, Metro, Santander and TSB.\\nAll of the banks listed financial or economic crime concerns as a reason for closing accounts but some did not separate this category from cases where customers had failed to pass all due diligence checks, for example, making it difficult to compare the data from different lenders.\\nNatWest said 97.1 per cent of its SME account closures were because of “concerns about financial crime or fraud, or due to NatWest\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009being unable to meet its regulatory obligations by continuing the [customer] relationship”.\\nHSBC said almost two-thirds of closures related to either customers’ financial viability or dormant accounts, with only 34 per cent connected to concerns about financial crime, such as money laundering.\\nOnly three of the eight banks — NatWest, Barclays and Santander — gave data for account closures related to their “risk appetite” at 1.4 per cent, 4.8 per cent and 10.2 per cent, respectively. Santander’s figure, however, included those accounts it closed for “non-compliance to policy”.\\nHarriett Baldwin, Conservative chair of the committee, said: “The fact that only three lenders included ‘risk appetite’ in their criteria indicates these discussions may not be systematically recorded, leaving questions over whether decisions on the debanking of certain businesses, based on what banks perceive as a risk, are happening informally.”\\nThe committee believed “any company engaged in a legal business activity in the UK should be able to find a bank to offer them a bank account”, she added.\\nMartin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the scale of the account closures revealed by the committee was “very troubling”.\\nHe called for the Financial Conduct Authority watchdog to publish figures quarterly “with properly defined reasons for each closure so that meaningful comparisons can be made and tracked over time”.\\nSMEs have raised wider concerns in recent months about their treatment by banks.

Britain’s regulators are playing catching up, investigating fees and undue costs of investment managers. On Thursday, AJ Bell offered reasons how it differs. Its share price leapt 18 per cent higher.\\nAs an industry disrupter AJ Bell’s success comes down to the low fees it charges for execution-only services. Pre-tax profits of £88mn rose 50 per cent last year. It is the interest rate spread that AJ Bell makes on customers’ cash — rather than fees — which drives its profit growth. Even so, that will catch the eye of regulators concerned with good customer outcomes.\\nSome content could not load.

Cash in accounts on its platform for investment advisers is low at just 3.6 per cent of assets. It is higher on its retail platform at 13.3 per cent of assets.\\xa0Neither figure surprised brokerage analysts. But regulator scrutiny could still force these levels down over time.\\nAJ Bell does offer its clients better rates on these balances. A partnership with savings marketplace Raisin gives AJ Bell’s customers access to some of the most competitive deposit rates for UK notice and term accounts. AJ Bell also pays between 1.95 per cent and 2.45 per cent on cash balances held in dealing accounts and share ISAs.

It’s called ‘open banking’ and it just took a big step forward in the world’s biggest market.\\nLast month, US regulators announced measures to allow consumers’ financial data to be shared easily, following similar reforms in Europe and Australia that make it simpler to switch bank accounts and sign up for a range of financial products.\\nBanks “know every time you tap your card, they see you got the [train], and you go get your coffee, and you’re spending your money there,” points out Philip Benton, an analyst at tech research group Omdia and an expert on digital banking. “They [already] have all that data. [So] the whole point of open banking and finance is opening that up to the wider ecosystem.”\\nThat is being made possible in the US by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under a new Personal Financial Data Rights rule that will, for the first time, guarantee Americans access to their data held at a bank or other provider at no charge. As a result, customers will be able to share that data with third parties — which will be subject to limits on how they use it — or revoke access to the data at any time.\\n“With the right consumer protections in place, a shift towards open and decentralised banking can supercharge competition, improve financial products and services, and discourage junk fees,” argues CFPB Director Rohit Chopra.\\nThis right to control your data is one reason it is much simpler to change banks in, say, the UK, than in the US. “Account ownership is sticky in the US, where you are more likely to get divorced than to switch bank accounts,” observes John Pitts, the global head of policy for US fintech Plaid, and a former CFPB official.\\nSuch portability of personal data, says Pitts, would also allow consumers to pick and choose “different products that either their bank doesn’t offer or [does] offer but someone else offers a version that better matches your need”. A customer would be able to use those more suitable products without leaving their main bank.\\nCountries to watch 2023-2027\\nVietnam The success of local payment network NAPAS has boosted digital payments growth, with cardholders expected to more than double by 2027\\nAustralia The real-time payment network PayTo, launched last year, will see increasing adoption over next five years as new use cases emerge\\nSaudi Arabia Fintech is a key aspect of the country’s goal of payments among individuals to be 70 per cent digital by 2025\\nSingapore\\nThe city-state’s authorities have bold ambitions for a QR-code based payment system\\nSource: FT-Omdia Digital Economies Index\\nOpen banking began as a UK government initiative in 2018, as part of Europe-wide efforts to foster competition and innovation, and break the stranglehold of legacy providers on personal finance. The biggest British banks were forced to share their customers’ data with third parties such as fintechs for the first time, under the authorisation of those customers.\\nFive years in, the results vary. Progress in achieving the aims of Europe’s Payment Services Directive Two, which implemented open banking in the EU, has been “disparate”, according to Daniel Jones, a partner at law firm Orrick who specialises in technology and finance.\\n“There are many, many jurisdictions I think in the EU that aren’t meeting the expectations set by the law,” he says.\\nEven the country that started it all has gone only so far. Jones says that, in the UK, the reforms have only had an effect on bank accounts and credit cards. “We are yet to really unlock the potential, which is the ability to compare things like mortgages or pensions,” adds Jones.\\nWhat happens in the US is therefore being keenly watched. While there is already widespread use of fintech apps that make use of customers’ data from other financial firms, that information is often gathered through “screen-scraping”, whereby bots copy it from a website using the customer’s log-in details. This can be unreliable and carries risks, including having more data than necessary taken by the third party.\\nIn the US, the new open banking rule will require that, as in the UK, banks provide application programming interfaces (APIs), which allow data to be easily shared. The CFPB says its rule will “require data providers to establish and maintain a developer interface for third parties to access consumer-authorised data”.\\nIn the UK, the huge cost of implementing the technological changes fell solely on the big banks, and not on the fintechs who stood to benefit from access to their networks — which caused conflict.\\n“I’m aware of certain large deposit-taking banks that have spent over half a billion [pounds],” says Jones.\\nIn the US, the problem is that, while Wall St institutions can bear the costs, there are thousands of small and medium-sized providers that might struggle. The CFPB notes that “there are more than 9,000 banks and credit unions across the country, most of which serve as data providers, as do numerous non-depository financial institutions”. Making all those financial institutions work seamlessly together is likely to be a Herculean task.\\nAccording to the Fintech Brain Food newsletter, written by commentator Simon Taylor, the fact that the CFPB rule does not let banks charge for API access “will further reinforce the perception that open banking has zero upside for incumbents and all downside”. He proposes some form of revenue-sharing, in which banks could receive a small transaction fee when customers use open banking via third parties.\\nHowever, the Consumer Bankers Association, which represents retail banks, has welcomed the new rule, which also seeks to regulate fintech companies. “Many of these entities that are collecting, storing and selling this consumer information are not subject to the same rigorous data security and privacy standards as well-regulated and supervised financial institutions,” it pointed out.\\nAnd the Financial Technology Association — the fintechs’ lobby group — says the rule will bring consumers “one step closer to having a strong right to control their financial data”.\\nIn addition, the regulatory changes should bring the US closer to the wider vision of Open Finance: having your entire financial life — spanning your deposit account, pension, mortgage, insurance and share portfolio — instantly available in the one place, and easily portable to different providers. Benton notes that Australia started with this idea — an open data rule that would expand to cover everything.\\nBut steep barriers to fully Open Finance remain.\\nThe first is a “huge trust issue” between the traditional banks and the third parties, says Jones. One unanswered question is who is liable in the event of fraud or the loss of data. What is needed, says Jones, is either clear legislation or a “killer app”.\\nIn a recent Omdia survey on open banking, the top priorities of the banks were online security and protecting against fraud.\\nPitts agrees that the question of trust is key. “When I think about a bank, the image for me is a vault — and the vault conveys trust in a deeply meaningful way,” he says. “I think you need that same level of trust in open banking, and that means appropriate regulation and policies and procedures when it comes to fraud and privacy.”', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/e0203daa-1eca-46fd-a122-f6b4e5e29ec2', 'title': 'America embraces Open Banking', 'publication_time': '2023-11-07T05:30:12.112Z'}, uuid=UUID('547018ff-1751-459f-81fc-337daf2640e1'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nSiddharth Venkataramakrishnan\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nFor many of the generation who came of age in the late noughties, earning good interest from savings accounts was until recently an unknown concept familiar only in the stories of their parents and grandparents.\\nIn the decade between August 2012 and November 2022, the average easy access rate did not surpass 1 per cent, according to data provider Moneyfacts.\\n“People had forgotten they used to get paid for having savings,” says Richard Davies, chief executive of challenger bank Allica. “For a decade you couldn’t really get paid [interest].”\\nOver the past year, that has changed rapidly. As lockdowns lifted, the Bank of England — like other central banks — drove rates up rapidly, reaching 5.25 per cent in August, as it sought to battle persistent inflation.\\nIn response, lenders — led by challenger banks — have pushed up the interest rates they offer savers. The average instant access account is now 3.28 per cent, while a one-year term account is 5.36 per cent.\\n“Thirteen years ago, you were lucky to get 0.5 per cent on an easy access account,” says Ravi Kumar, senior manager at sharia-compliant challenger Gatehouse Bank. “Now you look today, you can get more than 5 per cent. For every £1,000, that’s £50 back in your account compared to £5.”\\nFor a new generation of challenger banks looking to wrestle market share from slow-moving incumbents, the chance to offer higher savings rates gave them an opportunity to stand out — one which could offer significant benefits to savers.\\nThere is evidence that some have taken advantage of this. But industry data, analysts and even the challenger banks themselves say that the overall impact on the deposit market has so far fallen short of what might have been hoped. Deposits at the big banks remain sticky.\\n“It’s high street banks exploiting inertia,” says Davies. “[They] will claim they’ve got great rates on a few products if customers look for them, but it’s not what a lot of customers wake up and think about.”\\nFT Money explores whether the rebirth of competition in savings deals can lead to changes to the long-established structure of UK banking.\\nJust as the amount that customers make on savings has varied wildly in recent years, data from the Office for National Statistics shows that over 70 years, there have been considerable peaks and troughs.\\nThe biggest single impact on increased savings was the coronavirus pandemic. The average over the period is 8.4 per cent, but in the second quarter of 2020 the amount saved spiked by more than 20 percentage points to 27.4 per cent as lockdowns were imposed, travel was halted and opportunities to spend were curtailed.\\nFigures from the Bank of England also show that the kind of accounts that people have been putting their money into has changed over time. In the uncertainty of the pandemic in early 2020, inflows into both instant access and current accounts soared. From late 2022, fixed-term accounts were the main beneficiaries.\\n“You’ve seen the allocation of deposits to term product grow substantially during 2023,” says John Cronin, an analyst at investment bank Goodbody. “With the rising rate cycle, some savers have been willing to hold out for longer.”\\nHe points to NatWest’s third-quarter results, where 15 per cent of its deposits are now in term accounts, up from 11 per cent at the end of June.\\nKumar at Gatehouse said that this mirrored behaviour the challenger bank had seen among its customers.\\n“Previously, literally everybody was putting money into an instant access or maybe a bit in a one-year fixed-term account,” he says. “We’ve seen a new cultural behaviour of staircasing, taking savings deposits and splitting them across various different terms.”\\nResearch by Gatehouse estimated that about 14mn people in the UK now consider savings to be an essential outgoing, alongside costs such as fuel and other bills, in spite of the tough state of the economy.\\nThe study also found evidence of a generational gap in savings, but said young people with family and friends who were saving were more likely to do the same.\\n“With 18 to 24-year-olds, we found that they said they were influenced by friends and families — they’re ready to learn from those close to them,” Kumar says.\\nIn a low interest rate world, banks struggled to increase their net interest margin — the difference between what they pay for savings and charge when lending. As the rate has risen, it has become possible again for banks to make money on the gap between the two.\\nRecommended\\nThat has been particularly promising for digital challengers including Monzo, Starling and Chase UK (JPMorgan’s international offering) on the consumer side and SME-focused players, such as Allica.\\nThese banks, which supplanted earlier “challengers”, such as Virgin Money and TSB, have proved particularly popular with younger users — a survey from Monzo in the US last year found most customers were aged between 25 and 34.\\nFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA) data shows the gulf in rates which has emerged over the course of a year. In January 2022, the median instant access rate for the largest banks was close to the base rate of 0.25 per cent, with challenger banks offering 0.4 per cent. By July 2023, when the base rate had reached 5 per cent, digital challengers were offering an average of 3.7 per cent on the same accounts, compared with 2 per cent at major banks.\\nSavvy shoppers can find even higher rates today. Monzo offers 4.1 per cent on its regular savings account, a rate matched by Chase UK, JPMorgan’s international offering. The latter, which launched in September 2021, reached £15bn in deposits by May.\\n“You saw record flows over the past 12 months into challenger banks offering high interest accounts,” says Davies at Allica, who added that other beneficiaries included platforms such as Flagstone, which allow customers to spread their money in accounts at a number of banks to get the best rate.\\nData on market share puts this in a different light, however. Between January 2022 and March 2023, the nine biggest lenders — which includes Lloyds, HSBC, NatWest and Barclays, alongside Nationwide, TSB, Virgin Money and the Co-operative Bank — increased their savings market share from 48.3 per cent to 49.7 per cent, according to the FCA’s cash savings market review in July. Digital challengers, by contrast, grew their share from 3.7 per cent to just 3.9 per cent.\\nThere nonetheless remain opportunities for challengers. Research carried out by Allica, a bank focused on small and medium-sized businesses, estimated that small businesses are losing out on more than £7.5bn in interest every year based on the amount sitting in non-interest earning current accounts or in savings products which offer lower rates than large businesses.\\nCronin at Goodbody said that for challengers, picking up retail deposits was particularly valuable as a replacement for the Term Funding scheme for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (TFSME). The measure, first launched in 2016, was reintroduced by the BoE in 2020 to provide funding at costs close to the base rate and ensure small businesses did not collapse.\\nWith repayments for TFSME due to begin from next year, finding a new source of funding to replace it is vital. While big lenders are flush with deposits in current accounts, which cost little as they offer no interest, these make up a much lower proportion of the mix held by challenger banks, says Cronin.\\nThat makes savings accounts important for them, especially in a rising rate environment where wholesale funding costs are far higher than even a year ago.\\nRivals are not the only ones to accuse big banks of failing to offer decent market rates. Consumer rights groups have also been critical of the rates offered by incumbent players given the impact of persistent inflation.\\nAlthough the BoE held rates stable this week — a sign it does not believe further hikes are needed to tackle rising costs — there is still evidence that inflation remains unhelpfully strong.\\n“In the midst of the worst cost of living in decades, it’s crucial that those who can afford to put money aside are getting good returns,” says Jenny Ross, editor of Which? Money. “However, that’s been made much more difficult by some high street banks offering meagre returns.”\\nShe said that research from Which? estimated that poor rates could leave loyal customers who stick with their traditional banks short-changed by hundreds of pounds a year.\\nPoliticians and regulators have been paying increasingly close attention. That includes the FCA, which this year introduced a new Consumer Duty requiring firms to show that they are delivering fair value. In July, it called the chief executives of the UK’s largest banks and building societies to tell them that it wanted “to see that progress [on savings rate increases] accelerate”.\\nLenders initially said they were unable to tell savers who had opted out of marketing communications about better deals. A rare joint letter sent by the FCA and the Information Commissioner’s Office to the banking lobby group UK Finance disputed that argument.\\nLater that month, it released a 14-point “action plan” on cash savings, which included requiring those companies which offered the lowest rates to justify why they were not more competitive.\\n“The regulator has made clear that this behaviour will no longer be tolerated, and firms that continue to fail to offer fair value to customers should expect to face tough consequences,” says Ross.\\nMPs on the powerful Treasury select committee have also criticised senior bank executives, hauling them in to question their responsiveness on savings rates, drawing a comparison with the speed at which they increased mortgage rates.\\n“The big four banks have been far too slow to reward savers through better rates on instant access savings accounts,” says Harriett Baldwin, the committee’s chair. “They should have listened to our suggestion as there are signs that savvy consumers are switching for better rates elsewhere.”\\n“We will continue to press for individual and business savers to be rewarded,” she added. “Meanwhile, savers should shop around for the best rate.”\\nYet in spite of this, even challenger banks admit that the amount of deposits they have secured is only a fraction — around 4 per cent — of the overall market.\\nCompared with the third quarter of 2019, deposits at the four biggest banks have increased by about £220bn. Both NatWest and Lloyds reported net inflows in the third quarter in the past couple of weeks, although Barclays UK continued to see a decline.\\nAnalysts say this is at least in part a result of political pressure on the biggest players. “Back in the early part of the year when pressure started to mount from the Treasury select committee, you saw large banks increase their rates,” says Cronin.\\nAnd with rates at or very close to their peak, he said, further deposit moves are not expected to take place in the next few months, short of a major economic change.\\nBoE data suggests that the impact of the cost of living crisis is beginning to reverse the trend of late 2022, when people increasingly moved into fixed-term savings accounts.\\nGrowth in fixed term deposits is slowing, as is the amount leaving instant access or current accounts. In August 2023, outflows from the latter totalled more than £12bn while £8bn went into fixed term deposits. As of September, the instant access outflows were down to £9bn, while fixed inflows were just £5.3bn.\\nCronin ascribes that in part to the macroeconomic backdrop and impact of higher prices on households’ ability to put money into term deposits.\\n“There’s a danger that slips back a bit as people need the money to spend, which constrains the overall growth of deposit balances,” he said.\\nGary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, highlights the non-bank players adding to competition in the market. Most notable among them was National Savings & Investments, the state-owned savings bank, which raised the interest rate on its one-year fixed bond from 5 per cent to 6.2 per cent in August.\\nIt received £7.7bn in net inflows in September, the highest level in more than three years, and an increase of more than £7bn on August. The bond was later withdrawn.\\nDigital challengers may hope that this is a generational issue, given their greater appeal to younger users than traditional banks. But data from the current account switching service run by payments operator Pay.UK shows that NatWest and HSBC have seen the highest influx of customers. As 75 per cent of people keep savings with their current account provider, challengers may have to wait for that broader switch before they can make real inroads into the big lenders’ domain.\\nExecutives at challenger banks also argue that incumbent players are taking advantage of customers’ unwillingness to go through the hassle of moving their savings.\\n“Why do people leave money on deposit in a current account or in an easy access account which is giving them one and a bit per cent? There’s a term — lazy savers\\u2009— some people can’t be bothered,” says one. “They’re just not worrying about the rate of interest they’ve got.”\\nAnother is more sanguine about the outlook for disrupters.\\n“You’ve seen challengers coming in, raising good amounts of deposits and giving better terms for savers — but you still have larger amounts sitting in the clearing banks where people are very inert,” the person says. “Both things can be true because is the market is so deep.”', metadata={'query': 'Statistical analysis of account sharing demographics', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/5a32d71c-18b0-4ee1-b3b4-6d5704efd6fe', 'title': 'Challenger banks look to exploit higher savings rates', 'publication_time': '2023-11-03T05:00:35.566Z'}, uuid=UUID('c709d077-1fbc-479c-9013-0ed9c53da094'), db_id=''),\n",

Buyout firms also typically charge high fees to investors.\\nThe LGPS had about 4.3 per cent allocated to private equity two years ago, according to its 2021-22 annual report.\\nThe measures, which the government estimates could unlock about £30bn in funding for UK growth, were part of a broader package aimed at freeing up public and private pension capital to fuel the economy, against a backdrop of strained public finances.\\n“Today’s Autumn Statement contains big steps forward to create the long-term framework we need to drive investment into high-growth businesses in the UK,” said Michael Moore, chief executive of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association.\\nAnother proposal in the Autumn Statement aims to make it easier for employers to access surpluses built up in thousands of well-funded defined benefit (DB) “final salary” style pension plans.\\nMany of these schemes have swung into funding surpluses over the past 18 months after decades of deficits, driven by the high interest rate environment.\\nThe chancellor indicated on Wednesday that the current 35 per cent tax on surplus funds which are taken out of a scheme would be reduced to 25 per cent from next April.\\n“Today’s announcement represents a huge leap forward in plans to allow well-funded DB schemes to invest for growth,” said Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and now a partner with LCP, the actuarial consultants.\\nTo increase opportunities for these schemes to invest in productive finance while fully protecting member benefits, the government said it would consult this winter on how the Pension Protection Fund, the industry lifeboat scheme, could take on a new role as a consolidator for corporate pension schemes unattractive to commercial providers.\\n“This may be a precursor to the chancellor looking to the PPF to make the type of infrastructure investments/release of pension cash for investment that he raised in his Mansion House speech [in July],” said Rachael Healey, partner at law firm RPC.\\nMichael Tory, co-author of a report by the Tony Blair Institute which suggested wide-ranging reforms to the pensions market, welcomed reform of the lifeboat scheme.\\n“The PPF has for over 15 years now demonstrated\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009. that the crucial ingredients of scale, time horizon and professional management of diversified assets best secures long-term returns for savers — and the sooner these benefits can be extended beyond the PPF’s current remit the better,” he said.\\n“It makes no sense for UK savers that they can only gain these ingredients when their pension fund sponsor goes broke.”\\nFor personal retirement savers, the chancellor also confirmed plans to consult on sweeping changes to the pension market, to give workers the right to choose their own workplace pension fund. At present, employers are charged with choosing, on behalf of the workforce, a scheme to pay pension contributions into.\\nThe government said a “Lifetime Provider” pension model would give savers “greater agency and control over their pension” and would deal with the problem of millions of small pension pots building in the system as people move jobs.\\nBut some experts said this change, and the wider reform package, was exposing the pension system to “very significant risks”, including the high allocation for LGPS to private equity assets.\\n“Some measures are *very* ill-judged,” said Mick McAteer, a former board member of the Financial Conduct Authority, adding they could “undermine pension security, allow City [fund managers] to extract higher fees and reduce pension values”.', metadata={'query': 'Financial implications of implementing new policies', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/6ecb99d4-0503-4352-a385-72e9fe8335d4', 'title': 'Town hall pension schemes to be asked to double riskier asset allocations', 'publication_time': '2023-11-22T17:33:45.536Z'}, uuid=UUID('8afe61ec-b2a9-4bbc-b080-509a1ec476f7'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nThree very useful recent FT articles show a huge gap in economists’ current framework of analysis and make the case for much more stable monetary policy than we’ve seen since 2020.\\nSoumaya Keynes expertly summarises where economists reckon the equilibrium real rate of interest to be ( Opinion , November 3).\\nWhile economists are searching for R-star, the level of rates consistent with equilibrium in the real economy, Harriet Clarfelt ( Big Read , November 8) convincingly makes the case that corporate debt portfolios were structured for a world of ultra-lax monetary conditions and that today’s tighter policy environment will result in stress, with likely adverse implications for investment and growth.\\nMeanwhile, Ruchir Sharma ( Opinion , November 6) makes clear that flows of government debt are important determinants of bond yields, which affect both corporate borrowing costs and output and inflation.\\nTaking these pieces together shows there can be no macroeconomic equilibrium without simultaneous equilibrium in terms of financial stocks and flows.\\nMoreover, there needs to be equilibrium in the banking sector and other financial intermediaries, as the turmoil after the UK’s “mini” Budget in 2022 amply demonstrated.\\nUnfortunately, most economic and policy analysis ignores the vital role played by financial stocks and flows in determining macroeconomic outcomes. These shortcomings are most pronounced, and most likely to lead to policy errors, when there is a sharp shift from a lax to a stringent monetary policy regime. In those circumstances, what may be the long-run equilibrium real interest rate will be excessive for debt and portfolios structured for a lax regime, as Japan learnt in the 1990s.\\nEconomics is not a science where there are natural constants, though past averages can help in analysis.\\nR-star not only moves around but is also path-dependent, because debt and asset portfolios are path-dependent. The recent bond market roller-coaster convincingly makes the case that abrupt monetary policy shifts, as seen in 2020 and in the opposite direction since 2022, leave markets and economic agents bereft of a star to guide them. In those circumstances, avoiding a significant policy error boils down to luck.\\nThus, policy needs to be steadier and more predictable than we have seen since 2020. We would then have a far better guide to whether policy is too tight or too slack, and by how much.\\nPaul Mortimer-Lee Research Fellow, NIESR (UK) Purchase, NY, US', metadata={'query': 'Financial implications of implementing new policies', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a36ced69-eb21-4093-b65c-46ca40af86ce', 'title': 'Letter: Eco\\xadnom\\xadists search for R-star to guide them', 'publication_time': '2023-11-15T00:00:13.550Z'}, uuid=UUID('5cd26ffa-7f59-4ff2-8dbe-e47dc3a88a37'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nJosephine Cumbo in London\\nAt the chancellor’s annual Mansion House speech in July Jeremy Hunt set out wide-ranging reforms to Britain’s trillion pound pension sector that he said would “boost pensions (for savers) and increase investment in British businesses”.\\nHunt claimed his so-called Mansion House reforms could deliver an extra £1,000 a year in retirement income for today’s young savers and unlock up to £75bn in pension savings to invest in the UK economy.\\nBut the absence of pension reform from the government’s legislative programme in the King’s Speech this week raised questions about whether the chancellor can deliver on his ambitions.\\nA key plank of Hunt’s package was a voluntary agreement between nine of the UK’s largest defined contribution pension providers, which together hold a total of about £400bn in assets.\\nThe agreement, dubbed the “Mansion House compact”, committed the providers to allocating 5 per cent of assets in their default funds, which are the most popular types of fund, to unlisted equities by 2030.\\xa0According to the chancellor this could “unlock up to £50bn of investment into high-growth companies”.\\nHunt also set out proposals to double the allocation of local government pension schemes in private equity to 10 per cent, which he said could unlock a further £25bn by 2030.\\nA range of separate reforms aimed to create bigger and better-run pension plans, which are more suited to investing in higher growth, higher risk assets, such as unlisted companies.\\nAmong them was a controversial proposal for the state-backed pensions lifeboat fund to be given an expanded role as a consolidator of corporate pension plans, giving it a bigger pot of assets to invest in the economy.\\nAnother potential plan was for employers to be given easier access to defined benefit pension fund surpluses to encourage schemes to invest in riskier assets that could help boost the economy.\\nSome of Hunt’s changes require primary legislation, or a pensions bill, but others need only secondary legislation or guidance, say sector experts.\\nA bill would be needed to enact a new authorisation regime for new commercial defined benefit “superfunds”, which pool corporate pension fund assets.\\nThe establishment of a clearing house to stop small pension pots that accumulate as people change jobs from getting lost in the system would also require legislation. The proposed registry could lead to a modest boost in pension incomes, according to analysis published alongside the Mansion House package.\\nWhile these two proposals predated the chancellor’s July speech, the package also contained newer ideas to boost investment by defined benefit pension schemes in what the government termed “productive finance”, which were also not mentioned in the King’s Speech.\\nIndustry experts said they included proposals to ease access to defined benefit pension surpluses for employers that were still in the early stages of consultation.\\nMeanwhile, the Mansion House compact between defined contribution pension providers does not need legislation because it is voluntary, with the chancellor saying he would not force private sector funds to invest in specific assets.\\nOne government official said the legislation was not included because of a lack of parliamentary time, and insisted that many reforms could be carried out quickly by regulators working with the sector.\\nHowever, some industry figures said the government could be reserving the big pension announcements for the Autumn Statement later this month.\\n“If the government was going to do something it might not have wanted to have spoiled the news on the 22nd, the Autumn Statement,” said David Robbins, senior consultant with WTW, the professional services firm.\\nHe added: “The pensions stuff can be complicated and there may be some nervousness about how it will land” in an election year.\\nThe absence of a pensions bill in the King’s Speech raised eyebrows among some in the pensions sector, especially as attention was given to legislation for issues such as unlicensed pedicabs in London.\\n“We were all a bit surprised,” said Matt Tickle, partner and chief investment officer at Barnett Waddingham, the actuarial consultants. “We were all expecting something given it was a big part of the government’s plans.”\\nLCP, one of the UK’s biggest actuarial consultant groups, said in a statement that the absence of pensions legislation could “severely limit what can be achieved this side of the general election”.\\nThe group had previously put forward its own proposals to ease employer access to defined benefit surpluses as a route to stimulating funds to invest in higher growth, but higher risk assets, that mirror those floated by Hunt.\\nGovernment officials say steady progress is being made to deliver the reforms that do not require primary legislation.\\nLast month, 20 venture capital firms and an additional pension fund, Aon, agreed to join the Mansion House compact. The chancellor has also committed to respond to a raft of pension consultations linked to the reform package in his Autumn Statement.\\nThe Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, the industry trade body, said that while it was disappointing that the government did not include a pensions bill in the King’s Speech, “its absence will mean more time can be allocated to ensuring any reforms are well designed after in-depth consultation with the pensions sector”.', metadata={'query': 'Financial implications of implementing new policies', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/ef5315d3-0ccc-4693-a0fa-ed7b1019df78', 'title': 'Can Jeremy Hunt deliver on his pension reforms?', 'publication_time': '2023-11-09T12:01:49.937Z'}, uuid=UUID('24c59c99-7f1f-4626-b430-8ef11ee2df5a'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nLaura Noonan and Katie Martin in London\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nGlobal financial regulators are preparing a clampdown on so-called shadow banking as they confront the unintended consequences of previous waves reform that pushed risks into hidden corners of the financial system.\\nPolicymakers have been warning all year — with mounting alarm — about the risks and sizes of bets taken by some hedge funds and private equity houses. But now, fears that rising interest rates could derail some of their mammoth bets is turning that talk in to action.\\nIn recent weeks, the UK’s top financial regulator has drawn up plans for a probe into private capital valuations, while the Bank of England has declared such “non-banks” to be so important that policymakers should create a new facility to lend directly to them in times of crises.\\nGlobal watchdogs at the Financial Stability Board have launched a new review that could limit hedge fund leverage and increase transparency on their borrowings. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission has brought forward policies on fund transparency so stringent that some are suing in a bid to stop them.\\nTogether, the non-banks on regulators’ radar — which include hedge funds, pensions and insurers — account for 50 per cent of global financial services assets.\\n“Clearly there is work we still need to do,” Klaas Knot, chair of the FSB, told the Financial Times. “We are moving from policy development to policy implementation,” he said.\\nThe roots of the latest wave of financial regulatory lie, at least partly, in the era created by regulators following the 2008-09 global financial crisis when there was a rush to dramatically reduce risks in the banking sector.\\nAs banks have stepped back from trading in general and from investing in private assets, others have snapped up their market share. They include hedge funds, private equity houses and others outside the traditional banking sector. But they were not restrained by some rules for banks, especially restrictions on the amount of leverage on their trades, which potentially magnifies the size of their gains or losses.\\n“We never really thought that we were solving one problem and what would the knock-on be?” said one financial stability policymaker from that crisis era, arguing that regulators are now entering a “new phase”, where they have to ask “where did the risk pop out and how do we deal with that?”\\nAshley Alder, a veteran international markets regulator who now chairs the FCA, said the “turning point” in regulators’ thinking around non-bank financial risks was the March 2020 “dash for cash”, when bond markets went into freefall in the early pandemic, forcing central banks to intervene.\\nBefore then, the conversation had focused on whether to designate individual non bank institutions — such as major asset managers — as “too big to fail” as global regulators do with systemically important banks. Now policymakers had shifted to identifying risks across the shadow banking sector as a whole, Alder said.\\n“There is a question mark about what lurks out there,” he added, because regulators do not have good data on shadow banks’ exposures, something that has inspired the Bank of England’s world first marketwide stress test.\\nSeveral other causes for alarm have arisen. One is the spectacular near-death experience of pension fund hedging strategies in the UK one year ago. The implosion of investment house Archegos also bit a hole into several banks’ balance sheets in March 2021. The nickel market malfunctioned in March 2022 . And this year, an outsized burst higher in US government bond prices following the demise of Silicon Valley Bank drew regulatory concern over hedge funds’ bets.\\nThe causes of these breakouts were different, but the key protagonists were all part of the shadow banking universe, and each had been a risk lying in plain sight. Debt-funded bets on US government bonds by hedge funds are now under scrutiny .\\nIn recent months, as the dramatic rise in global interest rates has introduced new risks to a sector amped up on a decade of cheap debt, warning bells have reached a peak.\\nThe European Systemic Risk Board, the Bank for International Settlements and global securities regulator Iosco have all called out mounting risks.\\n“It is impossible to argue that market-based finance cannot threaten stability,” the BoE’s markets boss Andrew Hauser told a conference on Thursday.\\nIn that speech , he noted that policymakers needed to get the balance right between allowing investors to take their own risks, and global stability.\\n“I think we all need to accept that in markets there are risks and part of the function of markets is to be able to provide funding by taking certain risks,” says Verena Ross, chair of Europe’s securities regulator Esma. “At the same time, I think we still have pockets where there clearly are specific risks that I think we need to look at.”\\nAn overly heavy hand could end up creating yet more uncomfortable and unintended consequences, said a former financial stability policymaker who declined to be identified. “What is the answer?” he said. “Obviously no one wants no market volatility — that’s a bit weird. Also you don’t want the absence of leverage because we wanted that margining for good reason. But what is a blow-up? How much volatility is too much?”\\nHedge funds have come under particular scrutiny in recent months for a combination of reasons including their size, their opaque nature and the perception that they must take big risks to justify charging large fees for managing money.\\nEven prime brokers — the investment banks that lend to hedge funds — have limited visibility on the funds’ overall borrowings, a blind spot that was illustrated by the collapse of Archegos when the true scale of its borrowings from multiple brokers emerged only on its deathbed.\\n“We ask that question all the time. I’m relying on clients to tell me the truth,” says a senior banker at one prime broker. The FSB is looking at ways for banks to share information, but market sources say that would be a long and complicated effort.\\nAnother senior bond trader active with big investment houses and hedge funds said transparency was only one part of the problem. The other was size. “The dealer community is constrained on its balance sheets, and at the same time\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009. our clients now are just so much bigger than us. That shows up in moments of stress like after SVB failed.

It’s inevitable that the vast majority of start-ups fail, but the amount of venture capital a lot patently silly companies have incinerated in recent years is gobsmacking .\\nAnd those are just the start-ups. Zuckerberg has spent $36bn on developing a legless digital wasteland , while Apple has spent north of $22bn over the past year on\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009something, we hope. We’re not going to mention Amazon blowing $1bn on Rings of Power , because some of us actually quite liked it (ducks).\\nTo a lot of people, all these things are just symptoms of one fundamental force that has warped everything in the world for the past decade: zero-interest rate policies. Why not chuck money at increasingly fantastically stupid things when money is basically free? Now that rates have climbed again, we can all behold the detritus left in the wake of ZIRP.\\nBut maybe easy monetary policy and the bubbles it can stir still helps more than it hinders — at least if you focus on the macroeconomic forest rather than the shareholder trees?\\nFrom a new NBER working paper titled Monetary Policy and Innovation by Yueran Ma of the University of Chicago and Kaspar Zimmerman of the Frankfurt School of Finance:\\nWe document that monetary policy has a substantial impact on innovation activities. After a tightening shock of 100 basis points, research and development (R&D) spending declines by about 1 to 3 percent and venture capital (VC) investment declines by about 25 percent in the following 1 to 3 years. Patenting in important technologies, as well as a patent-based aggregate innovation index, declines by up to 9 percent in the following 2 to 4 years. Based on previous estimates of the sensitivity of output to innovation activities, these magnitudes imply that output could be 1 percent lower after another 5 years. Monetary policy can influence innovation activities by changing aggregate demand and correspondingly the profitability of innovation, and by changing financial market conditions. Both channels appear relevant in the data. Our findings suggest that monetary policy may affect the productive capacity of the economy in the longer term, in addition to the well-recognized near-term effects on economic outcomes.\\nBasically, easier monetary policy tends to stimulate R&D bonanzas, stir VC splurges and nurture innovation, while tighter monetary policy does the reverse.\\nAnd all that innovation tends to enhance the productivity and potential of an economy (in addition to the more obvious near-term impact of lower interest rates). In other words: bubbles should be praised! The broader economic gains of easy monetary policy outweigh the wealth destruction suffered by investors that are sucked in.\\nThis is not an entirely novel observation, of course. We’ve known for ages that easy monetary policy can inflate bubbles, and that while bubbles can destroy an immense amount of wealth when they burst, they still tend to leave behind something of real lasting value , even if it isn’t immediately clear what it is.\\nThe canal and railway manias of the 1790s and 1840s respectively helped transform the UK into the world’s leading economy, for example. More recently, the dotcom bubble did help finance an immense amount of innovation and cable-laying that we still benefit from today (as well as Pets.com).\\nPerhaps once all the stupidity enabled by the ZIRP era has washed away, we’ll realise that something good came out of it? ¯\\\\_ (ツ)_/¯ (Suggestions welcome below)\\nMa and Zimmerman stress that while their findings indicate that “monetary policy could have a persistent influence on the productive capacity of the economy, in addition to the well-recognized near-term effects on economic outcomes”, that doesn’t mean rates should be set permanently too low.\\nWe do not think our findings necessarily imply that monetary policy should be more dovish. It is well recognized that efforts seeking to perennially stimulate the economy with monetary easing can be ineffective or counterproductive. In addition, as recent research points to the effects of monetary policy on a growing list of economic outcomes, it seems challenging for monetary policy alone to balance all these dimensions.\\nWhich is true of course. But it still feels a little like they’re weaseling out of the clear implications of their research.

And the entire industry is gearing up to invest more on compliance and reporting technology.\\n“This is something keeping general counsels up at night. Private funds’ legal teams are very thinly staffed,” said Allison Rosner of recruiters Major, Lindsey and Africa. She said she had heard from several general counsels: “I need a clone or a mini-me.”\\nThe SEC estimated as part of its rulemaking process that new requirements for audit statements and quarterly performance reports would cost the industry $961mn annually. Regulations on unequal treatment of investors, as well as extra staff and legal costs connected to disclosures around fund expenses, would cost another $938mn.\\nThose costs do not include increased spending on tougher marketing rules that firms had to start complying with late last year as well as new “form FP” amendments that require rapid regulatory disclosure of big losses and other important events.\\nPrivate fund managers bent on staffing up are likely to poach from legal and compliance departments at traditional asset managers and banks, as well as from the SEC itself. Headhunters say they are getting requests for compliance experts who will be comfortable explaining to portfolio managers and investors the new rules on disclosure and consent.\\n“Stakeholder management is increasingly sought after by the business as they bring in new compliance and risk management people,” said Ellen Yaffe, a partner in Russell Reynolds’ financial services practice. “Funds are going to want fees to be explained in ways that clients accept them.”\\nThe spending and recruitment plans are moving forward even though six industry groups have filed suit t o stop the new private fund rules from going into effect. Firms are concerned that the case might still be pending or that a court loss would leave them unprepared to implement the new rules by their effective date, expected to be in roughly a year to 18 months, depending on fund size.\\nMuch of the spending will be front loaded, much as it was a decade ago when the industry had to comply with rules forcing private funds to register with the SEC. Firms are expecting to have to set up computer systems to track valuation, expenses and special arrangements with individual investors, known as side letters.\\n“A lot of smaller managers already spend a large portion of their operating budgets on compliance. This will increase barriers to entry,” said Michael Hong, a partner at the Davis Polk law firm.\\nFund managers will have to figure out how to comply with a mandate for investors to be treated similarly for redemption and disclosure purposes even when they are not in identical funds. The SEC has specifically warned the industry that treating investors in a healthcare fund and a tech fund differently could violate the ban on preferential treatment.\\n“Managers are left having to manage the process to make sure that everybody gets the information they want, but no one gets preferential information. People will be feeling their way through that,” said Jennifer Wood, who heads up regulation at the Alternative Investment Management Association.\\nManagers who sell shares to investors in funds that have already completed their fundraising, known as adviser-led secondaries, will also have to spend additional money on third-party valuation or fairness opinions to make sure investors know what they are buying. The SEC estimated that 10 per cent of funds offer secondaries annually.\\nThe whole compliance process will be complicated by another SEC pending proposal that would tighten requirements for outsourcing functions from custody to tech, lawyers said.\\n“It’s hard to build a scaleable system when you don’t know what else is coming down the pike,” said Marc Ponchione, a partner at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton. “In combination, these are not plug-and-play rules.”', metadata={'query': 'Financial implications of implementing new policies', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/6d39f967-e141-418c-aef0-76bb337c64ba', 'title': 'Private funds prepare to spend billions on compliance after SEC rule', 'publication_time': '2023-09-14T04:00:48.181Z'}, uuid=UUID('4c9452fd-e7d2-456f-8840-292ba567e771'), db_id=''),\n",

That is happening right now in the UK market for closed-end investment funds, also known as investment companies.\\nShould we care that the market for investment companies, which at the end of July had 377 companies and £267bn of assets, has in effect been closed by a regulatory desire for artificial tidiness? Many investors and investees are fuming that they are now blocked from investing in the productive economy. The question for the UK Treasury and the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, is: why haven’t you stopped the butterfly from flapping its wings?\\nThe first stirrings of this effect were discernible in the 2014 EU directive on packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPS), which included a requirement for retail investors in funds of funds to be given a single figure “aggregate” of the charges that would be taken from their investment. I was chair of the European parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee at the time.\\nIt was pointed out late in proceedings that UK investment companies were treated as funds ( regulated in Britain as collective investments) and best exempted from the directive. This didn’t happen, but for a long time it didn’t matter because that part of the PRIIPS directive was not activated. While I was in the chair, attempts to replicate the troublesome language in the EU’s Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (Ucits) were beaten off.\\nEnter Brexit and the FCA ’s desire to harmonise the different investment regimes and Investment Association guidance on cost disclosure. At this point, we find the butterfly effect being extended into Ucits and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid). Investment companies became subject to a “synthetic cost” calculation under which their corporate costs were added to the fund managers ongoing charges — even though they had already been taken into account in the share price. Shares in ordinary trading companies with identical business models can be held in funds without any synthetic cost being included. This makes investment companies look expensive to hold, as if the costs have to be taken off again from the share price, which is misleading.\\nThe other factor that has come into play, also as a result of historical excess charges, is the prevalence of cost caps. The inclusion of investment company synthetic charges causes these to be breached. And this has forced money managers to dump investment companies, despite their professional judgment about their value to their clients.\\nAs a consequence, there have been no significant initial public offerings of investment companies since the guidance started in January 2022 and follow-on funding has dried up. And, though it originated in the PRIIPS directive, this is a distinctly British issue due to the unique way our investment companies are regulated. Increasingly, large investment companies with internal management are shunning the IA’s guidance — after all, it is not compulsory. Meanwhile, those companies with external authorised corporate directors are, by and large, being forced to comply.\\nSo what remains of the playing field is uneven. Unfortunately the hardest-hit sectors are productive and vital parts of the economy for which it is hard to raise funds or trade in other ways. Examples include solar, wind and battery power in the clean energy sector, real estate and private equity.\\nWhat, then, should be done? My view is the same as the one that the US takes with yield companies — they are companies and should be treated as such when it comes to corporate costs, just like the rest of the world. No one objects to transparency on fees — and they are a major focus for investment company non-executive directors. But there is no need for this confusion.

It also put new limits on secret side deals that give better terms to some investors.\\nThe package, approved by a 3-2 vote, marks the most sweeping changes in more than a decade for a lightly regulated and rapidly growing global industry that serves pension funds and universities and is increasingly looking to work with wealthy individuals. Since 2012, the number of private funds has more than tripled to more than 100,000.\\n“Economically, our investors, large or small, benefit from greater transparency and integrity,” SEC chair Gary Gensler said after the vote. “These are significant enhancements in the capital markets.”\\nIndustry groups have lobbied furiously against the proposals since they were first put forward in February 2022, saying institutional investors should be free to make their own deals with fund managers. They contended that tighter regulation will stifle innovation, raise expenses and force investors and fund managers to tear up tens of thousands of existing contracts.\\nThe rule “is unnecessary government interference\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009[that] will squelch competition in the name of enhancing it,” said Hester Peirce, a Republican commissioner who laid out many of the industry’s objections to the rule before voting against it. “The market has not failed.”\\nThe final package dropped or modified some of the proposals that most worried the industry. Notably, it eliminated changes to fund liability rules that would have allowed investors to sue for “negligence” rather than “gross negligence”. It also substituted disclosure requirements for outright bans on some preferential treatment and some controversial fees.\\nThe SEC rule also adds an element of “grandfathering”, which will mean some contracts can stay intact, and phases in most requirements over a one- to two-year period.\\nThe commission pushed ahead with required quarterly performance reports with standardised metrics that will make it easier to compare funds.\\nIt also banned the practice of giving some investors favourable redemption rights and additional information about fund holdings, unless they are offered to everyone. The SEC will also require disclosure or explicit investor consent when funds want to pass on compliance costs.\\n“This is industrial policy. The SEC wants to be much more involved in the oversight of these institutions,” said Brian Daly, partner at Akin.\\nThe new rules would impose “significant costs” and big changes on the industry, said Elizabeth Shea Fries, partner at Sidley. “This is trying to make private funds more like registered funds.”\\nFinancial reform groups and Democratic lawmakers praised the SEC for taking steps to regulate private funds but some criticised the agency for softening some of its original proposal in the face of criticism.\\nRecommended\\n“These rules will help protect workers’ pensions and create a more transparent and accountable private funds market,” said Senator Sherrod Brown, who chairs the banking committee.\\nBut Stephen Hall, legal director of Better Markets, said, the final rules “fall short of what’s necessary to protect investors from the appalling array of unfair, predatory and opaque practices.”\\nFund industry groups, which had threatened to file suit to stop the draft rules from going into effect, said they were pleased the final rules had taken into account their comments but warned they still had concerns.\\n“We will be focusing on its potential to stifle innovation and harm the economic environment for venture and start-ups,” said Bobby Franklin, chief executive of the National Venture Capital Association.\\nJack Inglis, chief executive of the Alternative Investment Management Association, said: “The rules adopted today still contain several areas of concern\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009we will be discussing our options.”', metadata={'query': 'Financial implications of implementing new policies', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/7b31f328-27b0-4a96-8477-1aa2b6bd3ae4', 'title': 'US regulators impose tougher disclosure rules on private funds', 'publication_time': '2023-08-23T18:30:44.540Z'}, uuid=UUID('bcc5bd2e-20dc-48f3-a25d-6f09ba2480c1'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nThe editorial board\\nA year after the US Inflation Reduction Act was passed, the British government is developing an “advanced manufacturing plan”. The details are sketchy, but it is just the latest in a new wave of industrial policies following America’s multibillion-dollar package of incentives affecting sectors from electric vehicles to green hydrogen production.\\nNew factories are already sprouting across the US . But the scale of government intervention combined with provisions that favour domestic production leaves most economists sceptical about its long-term impact. Trying to replicate global green, tech and battery supply-chains at home is a tall order. Pulling production away from where it can be done most efficiently is wasteful and raises costs. It also invites retaliation.\\nDeveloping an industrial policy, particularly in a time of geopolitical fragmentation, is fraught with complexity. But as more governments seek to emulate and respond to the IRA, there are some principles worth heeding.\\nFirst, any economic strategy should place emphasis on creating a welcoming business environment that fosters competition. This enables existing strengths to flourish. Investing in modern infrastructure, developing an effective training system and designing an immigration policy that attracts global talent is important. Meanwhile, an openness to trade, a stable long-term policy environment and minimal red tape will support investment decisions and help industries achieve scale. As it is, the IRA is facing shortages of skilled workers and lengthy planning delays .\\nBeyond this, targeted support should be considered in a few cases. First, to build capabilities that are integral to national security, such as defence, and for securing supplies of critical materials. And second, to tackle market failures. For instance, renewable infrastructure may need a jump-start when the private sector is unclear about future demand but long lead times mean preparation needs to happen in the present.\\nTargeted interventions should not aim to recreate entire global supply chains at home, but rather develop a foothold in these clearly and narrowly defined strategic sectors. This helps to limit wasteful spending and accusations of unfair trading practices. Time-limited support is important too. Indeed, the latest forecasts show the IRA’s open-ended tax credits could exceed $1tn.\\nThe type of policy tool used should match the issue it is trying to tackle. For instance, green energy projects obtain certainty from a guaranteed market price and public-private partnerships help de-risk otherwise unviable projects for battery or semiconductor plants where no foothold exists. Financial incentives, such as tax credits, can play an important role meanwhile in encouraging the shift of resources from low to higher productivity industries. Indeed, they are most cost effective and less distortionary when applied across sectors to encourage investment in training, R&D, and machinery, as well as the adoption of existing technologies.\\nAbove all, industrial policy should not exclude competition . For decades, globalisation based on international supply chains connected by national specialisms has driven productivity growth. But protectionist measures, including local content rules in the IRA, undermine this by coddling domestic manufacturing and sparking tit-for-tat measures. Friendshoring, or free trade between allies, offers an alternative to trading with malign states.\\nRising to the challenges of the climate transition, technological change and unstable geopolitics requires targeted and well-designed interventions from national governments. But if leaders decide increasingly to override free markets and open trade, they will find it even harder to reach their goals.', metadata={'query': 'Financial implications of implementing new policies', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/8e4278a8-9f8c-42a6-8168-6d0b234a2d16', 'title': 'Principles for good industrial policy', 'publication_time': '2023-08-23T17:17:45.646Z'}, uuid=UUID('af513321-70d4-4352-8229-84f817744482'), db_id=''),\n",

This approach was previously avoided because contract schemes do not have trustees to advise whether a merger is in members’ interests.\\nThe proposals would result in a “much smaller” number of multiemployer schemes according to the government’s consultation documents , published on Thursday. There are currently about 30 authorised master trusts and 30 providers of contract-based schemes, with assets of around £130bn and £350bn respectively last year, according to the government and New Financial think-tank.\\nContract-based schemes tend to have lower allocation in private markets such as private equity funds and infrastructure assets than master trusts, which fall under the remit of the pensions regulator.\\n“The proposals are genuinely radical and would, over the course of this parliament, reshape UK workplace pensions,” said Patrick Heath-Lay, chief executive of master trust provider People’s Partnership. “The result would be a sharp consolidation of pensions provision creating fewer, much larger providers.”\\n“It looks like the government are deadly serious about intervening in the DC market to create megafunds,” said Gregg McClymont, executive director at IFM and a former Labour MP.\\nThe government has proposed that 86 local councils across England and Wales hand over the management of all £392bn of their combined assets to one of eight pools — or so-called megafunds — by March 2026.\\nThis will accelerate an existing trend. Councils already invest some of their funds through these pools — by March this year about 45 per cent of local government pension assets were invested via pools’ sub-funds.\\nBut the government has also set out rules for how the pools should operate — requiring them to be investment management companies authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, with expertise and capacity to implement investment strategies.\\nLocal councils will have the choice whether or not they set an investment strategy, but they will be required to “fully delegate” the implementation of this to the pool, and to take their principal advice from the pool.\\n“It’s great that the chancellor has backed our argument for fewer, bigger LGPS investors with the in-house expertise to inject equity into infrastructure and housing assets,” said Tracy Blackwell, chief investment officer of the Pensions Insurance Corporation. “A country that needs more infrastructure investment needs more natural equity sponsors for strategic infrastructure projects.”\\nOthers are less impressed.

       "  (Document(text='\\nJohn Plender\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nAccountancy matters, not least because it changes behaviour. In a year of elections and political shifts, the point is worth making because conventional accounting is sending some exceptionally misleading signals for policy.\\nConsider, first, central bank finances. Central banks are incurring losses on assets they bought through so-called quantitative easing after the 2007-09 financial crisis and during the pandemic. On a mark-to-market basis, many have negative equity capital and are thus technically insolvent.\\nThis sounds scary. Yet central bank balance sheets are curious because they exclude central banks’ most valuable asset: seigniorage, or the profit made on creating money. Only if the shrinkage in equity capital is greater than the net present value of future income from seigniorage is a central bank insolvent.\\nThat seems implausible today in the advanced countries. Note that we are talking here about public institutions with a monopoly right to create money, government backing and protection from bankruptcy proceedings. In some cases, most obviously the Bank of England, there is full government indemnification against losses on QE purchases.\\nEconomists at the Bank for International Settlements find little evidence of any systematic relationship between central bank equity buffers and subsequent inflation. Indeed, the central banks of Mexico, Chile, Israel and the Czech Republic have operated for long periods with negative equity without policy going awry.\\nThe one caveat relates to perception. Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, in their renowned monetary history of the US, showed that the Federal Reserve’s concern for its own net worth helped prevent a more aggressive response to the 1930s Depression.\\nToday’s equivalent would be to allow short-term central bank losses to affect judgments about long-term public debt sustainability while forgetting those losses were incurred to boost economy-wide income, so broadening the tax base — something Britain’s new Labour government should ponder. That said, if fiscal support for a central bank is lacking, market participants may fear that it will issue additional reserves to finance its liabilities, thus eroding trust in money and putting price stability at risk. And if governments take advantage of a perceived need to recapitalise central banks and seek to influence policy, central bankers’ independence could be threatened.\\nYet the fact remains that central bank accounting capital will generally be a deficient guide to assessing policy effectiveness and solvency.\\nTurn now to pensions, which offer an extreme example of how a change in accounting can damage the structure of an entire industry to the detriment of the economy. In the 1990s, accounting standard setters in the UK decided that pension fund surpluses and deficits should be recorded on company balance sheets. Finance directors responded by closing defined benefit pension schemes to new entrants, while trustees tried to de-risk their funds by resorting to liability-driven investment. Such LDI funds invested in assets, mainly gilts, that produced cash flows timed to match pension outgoings.\\nThis risk aversion was compounded because an important asset — the sponsoring company’s guarantee to meet pension scheme deficits — goes unrecorded in pension fund accounts. That in turn influenced regulators that sought to prevent employer failure at any cost and protect the country’s back-up Pension Protection Fund from employer insolvencies. They applied pressure for trustees to adopt LDI when gilts were offering threadbare returns.\\nCompanies were thus obliged to pour cash into pension funds that might otherwise have been used, inter alia, for investment in the real economy. Their pension funds’ equity holdings were run down to near zero. And because gilt returns were dismal, the funds borrowed to boost returns. Hence pension funds came to pose a systemic risk, resulting in the gilt market crisis of 2022 when surging interest rates and collateral calls caught overborrowed funds off guard.\\nPerhaps the biggest gap between accountancy and the real world concerns externalities such as environmental pollution. Market prices and company accounts do not fully reflect the related social costs.\\nWith decarbonisation, these externalities have to be internalised. The lives of fossil fuel-intensive assets need to be shortened, raising depreciation charges and bringing asset writedowns to align with emissions reduction targets — difficult when much information for sustainability reporting comes from companies’ value chains over which they have limited control. In a patchy framework of reporting standards, most investors believe that stock market pricing inadequately reflects climate change realities.\\nThe charitable verdict is that sustainability reporting is a work in progress. The wider lesson is that policymakers, regulators and investors need to be acutely aware of the lacunae between conventional accountancy and economic reality. Likewise of the risk that radical accounting changes can spawn unintended consequences.\\njohn.plender@ft.com\\nLetter in response to this article:\\nHow no one considered FRS17’s real-world impact / From William Salomon, London W11, UK', metadata={'query': 'Financial implications of implementing new policies', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/e498256e-7d91-43a6-b84a-9084ce244b2a', 'title': 'The risks of radical accounting changes', 'publication_time': '2024-08-14T04:00:14.318Z'}, uuid=UUID('32cc9d76-5ffa-40c6-9e94-a4afc279098f'), db_id=''),\n",

Chris Giles made that point when proposing that the Bank of England should cease to pay interest on all of the deposits commercial banks hold with it (“A needless banking subsidy whose time is up”, Opinion , June 7).\\nPaying interest on those deposits was an efficient way of influencing interest rates when the deposits were small.

       "  (Document(text='\\nRobin Harding\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nImagine a policy that adds 1 per cent of GDP a year to the fiscal resources of a large, advanced economy. This policy works like magic. The money appears out of nowhere, with no rise in taxes, no cuts in spending, no assets sold and no debt to pay back. Such a policy would have great appeal to cash-strapped governments around the world and is surely too good to exist. Nevertheless, exist it does. Any guesses? The answer is a 2014 reform to the Government Pension Investment Fund of Japan, the world’s largest pool of retirement savings, in which it took on some currency and equity risk.\\nUndertaken by former prime minister Shinzo Abe, the 2014 reform shifted the GPIF from a largely domestic portfolio, with 60 per cent held in Japanese government bonds, to one that is 50 per cent equity and 50 per cent international. According to Stephen Jen and Joana Freire of Eurizon SLJ Capital, the portfolio has grown from ¥137tn in 2014 to ¥226tn today, compared with the ¥168tn at which it would now stand if the fund had kept it unchanged. The extra return amounts to about 10 per cent of Japan’s GDP, or $370bn, which must make it the most lucrative asset allocation review in history.\\nThe portfolio has benefited, of course, from the weakness of the yen, which fell from roughly ¥100 to the dollar to roughly ¥150 over this timeframe, but that is the point of taking currency risk, not a lucky accident. A period of bad asset returns could wipe out some of the gains. This is, however, a policy experiment that the world should study. Here are six lessons.\\nFirst, Japan has reason to be grateful to Abe, who was prime minister from 2012 to 2020 before his assassination in 2022. Opponents attacked the GPIF reform as speculation with the public’s retirement savings but Abe and his advisers showed leadership, riding out periods of bad publicity when the fund’s value went down. The GPIF reform may not be his greatest legacy but it is one to be proud of.\\nSecond, it highlights the importance of looking at net rather than gross public debt. Japan famously has the world’s largest gross public debt at 252 per cent of GDP. Its net public debt stands at 158 per cent of GDP, with the assets in the GPIF making up a chunk of the difference. Imagine an alternative reform in 2014, which used the GPIF money to cancel government bonds. In that case gross debt would have fallen, but Japan would have missed out on the excess returns from the investment portfolio and net debt would now be 10 percentage points higher.\\nThird, the GPIF’s shift shows a different way to think about public finances. In some sense, a government is like the ultimate university endowment fund or life insurance company: it is designed to exist forever, it has long-term obligations to future pensioners and a huge capacity to absorb risk.\\nThe government can invest in public sector assets that will generate future tax returns, such as education and roads, but it can invest in private sector assets as well. In circumstances where the private sector is hungry for safe assets such as government bonds, and willing to buy them at very low interest rates, it may well make sense to issue more, increase the public sector’s leverage and invest for a higher return. Jen and Freire suggest that the US Social Security Trust Fund, which is currently an accounting entity that only invests in special US Treasury bonds, should follow the GPIF into other assets.\\nFourth, the GPIF reform was relatively conservative. The portfolio shift was made consciously, with careful attention to risk, asset management by professionals and politicians kept at arm’s length. That makes a depressing contrast with an economically similar scheme in the UK, whereby local governments sought to fix their lack of tax revenue by borrowing billions of pounds from the central government, and investing it in commercial property and other assets. A number, such as Thurrock, Woking and Warrington, have got themselves into deep financial trouble. It will always be easy to confuse prudent use of the state’s balance sheet to fund long-term liabilities using long-term assets, and speculation to keep short-term tax rates low.\\nFifth, the GPIF’s shift could apply to other pools of assets. For example, Japan is one of a number of Asian countries that maintains foreign exchange reserves much greater than it needs. If Tokyo does not want to take advantage of the weak yen to sell some dollars and retire some debt — which would be quite sensible — then it could shift some of these reserves into equities too, or hand them over outright to the GPIF. The way Hong Kong handles the investment portion of its Exchange Fund is an interesting example.\\nFinally, there is a case to make this kind of reform early. Not only are the benefits accrued and the risks best managed over time, but the world continues to age and the demand for pension-paying assets rises with it. The return of inflation has made everybody feel better about returns but there is little sign that real interest rates — after inflation — have moved sustainably higher.\\nIn finance there is never any free lunch. Return always comes with risk. But as ageing societies confront a rising fiscal burden, the success of Abe’s GPIF reform shows the merit, for governments, of thinking less like debtors struggling to pay the bills, and more like investors with large obligations, large balance sheets and a very long time horizon.\\nrobin.harding@ft.com\\nLetter in response to this comment: Optimism over Japanese pension funds not justified / From Robert Madsen, Menlo Park, CA, US', metadata={'query': 'Financial implications of implementing new policies', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/2d66e190-3845-47ac-a764-2c5034a94cf4', 'title': 'What Japan’s most profitable policy experiment can teach us', 'publication_time': '2024-05-15T00:00:41.886Z'}, uuid=UUID('0b6db8cd-2ff4-4bd8-a98d-4f71f3ff5d9f'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nMartin Sandbu\\nThis article is an on-site version of Martin Sandbu’s Free Lunch newsletter. Premium subscribers can sign up here to get the newsletter delivered every Thursday. Standard subscribers can upgrade to Premium here , or explore all FT newsletters\\nComing up is spring meetings week for the IMF and World Bank, which means the great and the good of economic policymaking will soon be assembled in Washington. In the run-up, the fund begins to release its reports, chapter by chapter, which are always worth keeping an eye on as they tend to take the pulse of where mainstream economic policy thinking is placed and where influential decision makers would like that thinking to move. Below I consider one of the first reports out.\\nIn a chapter of its Fiscal Monitor, published yesterday , the IMF has taken on industrial policy. Its stated motivation is a little curious: that it is necessary for every country to boost productivity, and the way to productivity growth is through more innovation, so we should look at how industrial policy can boost innovation. I say “curious” not because this is a bad reason, but because the renewed interest in industrial policy — the return of the state in steering how the economy develops — has generally been motivated by quite different things. In particular, leaders have focused on their goal of getting net carbon emissions to zero to address climate change, and on the imperative of reducing economic dependence on strategic goods and services in countries that are geopolitical adversaries.\\nThis might seem to make the report, while useful on its own terms, too narrow to be relevant to today’s policy debates. Happily, however, the focus on innovation aligns nicely with the concerns more immediately on governments’ minds. The carbon transition is, after all, largely about changing the technologies we use for energy, movement and production — that is to say, innovating and technologically upgrading our way to a better economy.\\nDig into the report, and this connection emerges clearly from the fund’s research. Target fiscal support for research and development could increase output by 2 per cent in a large country. The effect more than doubles, to 5 per cent, for a country that directs its innovation incentives to green sectors — because this helps address the economic damage from pollution and climate change, and because the ability to measure emissions can make for more precise targeting of funds than more nebulous policy criteria.\\nThe fund would not be the fund if it did not warn about how everything can go wrong. So it points out that if business lobbies influence the politics of subsidies, misallocation can quickly turn a net gain into a net loss. Moreover, small open economies get most of their innovation benefit from outside anyway, and their own innovation policies would mostly benefit countries. This does not mean small economies should not boost innovation subsidies, but that they should do so in co-ordination with one another — like EU member states do through common programmes. As EU countries approach decision time for the bloc’s next budget (see “Other readables” below), they should take note of this argument for jumping together.\\nThe IMF identifies some useful targets for innovation-focused public spending. Basic research has a high rate of return. But so, too, does spending that increases the diffusion of frontier technology across borders and from leading companies to the rest of the economy.\\nOn the first count, raising the population’s education level and improving digital infrastructure are good ways to boost services imports and foreign direct investments, both important channels for technology diffusion. (More spending on education, for example, can boost an emerging or developing country’s national income by nearly twice as much.) The fund cites research that corporate tax rates have little effect on investment allocations, and proposes that developing countries could remove tax breaks for companies and invest in skills and connectivity instead. Not exactly your old Washington consensus.\\nAs for technology diffusion within countries, the fund wants governments to focus on start-ups and smaller companies, which may often be more innovative than the established giants that are likely to gobble up all the public support if they get the chance. The solutions include more inclusive procurement policies, lower industry barriers to entry and generous loss carryforward policies — which are particularly helpful for start-up companies that still have a way to go before making any taxable profits. That holds for refundable tax credits as well, which the IMF also duly recommends. It bears noting that refundable tax credits are the backbone of the US’s Inflation Reduction Act.\\nBut beyond the detailed prescriptions, the overall message is that fiscal spending on innovation can pay for itself. That is excellent news. Yet the fund can’t help itself: it worries about high-debt countries running out of “fiscal space” and so having to reprioritise other spending. I have written before that the whole notion of fiscal space borders on incoherence . But let’s suppose it here just means a risk that a government becomes unable to borrow money to spend. If so, then the fund’s boilerplate warning means something truly worrying: that financial markets cannot provide a government with the liquidity to do something that more than pays for itself (ie spending that improves rather than worsens its public finances). That would be a profound dysfunction of private markets and something that policy thinkers, including at the IMF, should clearly take on and think about how to fix — rather than just telling governments not to go there.\\nIt also leaves me wondering: what about monetary policy? This is a report only about fiscal policy, of course, but what the best fiscal policy is both determines and depends in part on what the best monetary policy is. And the simple fact is that the way we do monetary policy now has meant that investing in green tech is a lot more expensive today than it was for a decade until three years ago. If we are serious about decarbonisation, we should really think hard about whether we have the right set-up for monetary policy.\\nCentral bankers have been thinking about this, but so far their moves towards “greening” their policies have been minimal in terms of impact. Should they do more? I was struck by my colleague Zehra Munir’s reporting on French President Emmanuel Macron’s musings on the need for a green interest rate to be distinguished from a “brown” rate. She suggests some central bankers may be thinking about using the next rate-cutting cycle to introduce instruments that lower the financing cost of green projects more than brown ones — and it seems to me that central banks whose instruments work primarily through the banking system, such as the European Central Bank, are particularly well placed to make this happen.\\nMobilising the powers of monetary policy looks overdue. I already wrote about the need to target the “green spread” four years ago . And as a recent article in Nature shows, our legacy financial system seems to be biased in the opposite direction: because historical risk data shows carbon-intensive projects to be safer investments than innovative green tech, regulatory requirements make the former cheaper to finance. Of course, the best way to fix this is to update our regulatory system. But even if that were done — and certainly while it isn’t — the second-best package of policy would seem to include more activist fiscal and monetary policy alike.\\nThe EU’s pandemic recovery fund is already shaping the bloc’s future , including by restarting economic convergence between south and north.\\nThe fugitive executive of Wirecard, the fraudulent fintech giant, seems to have been a Russian intelligence asset in Europe .\\nAnd about that\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.

For decades the plans — which promise guaranteed pensions calculated on salary and length of service — formed the bedrock of British workplace pension provision.\\nMore recently employers have opted for cheaper defined contribution schemes, where members have no certainty over what income they will get in retirement.\\nThe committee said current DB schemes needed “confidence that the additional [investment] flexibilities that have been promised will be reflected in the actual approach regulators take in future”.\\nAs a signal of the required change in approach, it recommended that TPR’s objective to safeguard the Pension Protection Fund, the industry lifeboat, be replaced with a new objective to protect future, as well as past, service benefits.\\nAt present, TPR has no objective to protect future service benefits. The aim of protecting the PPF is widely viewed as a key reason why schemes were encouraged to switch to less-risky assets.\\nAbout 1.2mn workers belong to DB schemes that are open to new joiners, including the UK’s largest scheme, the Universities Superannuation Scheme.

Those powers could include a ban on funds taking on new business from employers.\\nThe pension reforms are part of Hunt’s efforts to stimulate the economy and will include a requirement for so-called defined contribution pension funds to disclose from 2027 how much they invest in the UK.\\n“We have already started on a path to drive growth, unlock capital for our most promising companies and improve outcomes for savers — and these new rules mean employers and savers can see how their money is invested and how the returns compare to other schemes,” Hunt said.\\n“British pension funds appear to contribute less to the UK economy than international counterparts do as they invest less in our domestic businesses. These requirements will help focus minds on how to improve overall returns and outcomes for savers.”\\nNausicaa Delfas, chief executive of The Pensions Regulator, said with more disclosure helping to spark competition between schemes, and enhanced powers to crack down on poor performers, “we can really deliver for savers, now and in the future.”\\nYvonne Braun, director of long-term savings at the Association of British Insurers, welcomed the plans to compare the performance of pension providers. She said that “focusing the pension system on value rather than cost alone will be hugely beneficial for savers.”\\nMembership of workplace pensions has grown by more than 10mn since reforms requiring employers to automatically enrol staff into company retirement plans came into force in 2012 with around £116bn invested annually, according to government estimates.\\nThe Treasury said it was introducing the disclosure requirement for UK investments because inconsistent reporting by defined contribution pension funds was “sometimes making it difficult for policymakers and savers to understand where this money is invested.”\\nRecommended\\nSo-called defined benefit pension funds are already subject to disclosure requirements on their asset allocation.\\nFurther details of the proposed reforms will be set out in a consultation by the Financial Conduct Authority later this year.\\nThe FCA has been resistant to some aspects of Hunt’s disclosure requirements because there was no evidence that consumers or markets were being harmed by the absence of such disclosures, the Financial Times reported earlier this week.\\nNigel Peaple, spokesperson for the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, the workplace pension trade body said: “Investment must be in the interest of pension savers and we look forward to working with the government and the FCA on defining the right benchmarks.”\\nAdditional reporting by Ian Smith\\n\\n', metadata={'query': 'Financial implications of implementing new policies', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/7508d1f3-72a8-40ba-aea5-8f01e99e4bbe', 'title': 'Poorly performing UK pension plans to face ban on new members', 'publication_time': '2024-03-02T00:01:16.480Z'}, uuid=UUID('577b3e31-7a29-4455-a1d3-80aa043b9280'), db_id=''),\n",

Management fees increased to 1.54 per cent from 1.46 per cent last year.\\nHedge funds have historically been known for a “two and 20” fee model, where investors pay 2 per cent in management fees every year and 20 per cent on any performance gains. In reality, investors rarely pay fees that high, especially for small to medium-sized hedge funds.\\nThe 2024 increase in fees reflects how global investors are allocating billions of dollars to multi-manager hedge funds that emulate Ken Griffin’s Citadel and Izzy Englander’s Millennium and which have come to dominate the industry.\\nThese firms pursue expensive models that can rely on hundreds of portfolio managers trading a variety of strategies across markets, and so charge higher overall fees than the average hedge fund. Many have consistently made large gains for investors, even during downturns in the equity markets.\\nThese firms often charge performance fees of 20 per cent. Marlin Naidoo, head of capital introductions at BNP Paribas, said allocators had allocated money to the large managers who tend to have higher performance fees, pushing up that figure.\\nSome multi-managers do not charge management fees, with many opting for a so-called pass-through model where they charge all expenses, including salaries and technology spending, directly to investors. In practice, the pass-through model is equivalent to fees on investor assets of between 3 per cent and 10 per cent.\\nRecommended\\nBNP’s survey does not count the pass-through fee as a management fee, but does take account of the multi-managers that do charge a management fee, which is often above the industry average.\\n“[Investors] have also allocated to funds which pass through some costs to investors that also charge a management fee of 2 per cent or higher, which has resulted in a jump in fees paid,” added Naidoo.\\nThe pass-through model is controversial with some investors, who argue it does not incentivise management to keep costs down. BNP Paribas’s survey showed that last year investor returns from managers that did not operate the pass-through model beat hedge funds that did.\\nThe Financial Times has previously reported that some multi-manager hedge funds that do charge a pass-through, such as Balyasny and Schonfeld, had a disappointing year for performance in 2023.', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/0e82ad86-5967-4034-ad9b-a00c4db8708f', 'title': 'Investors pay higher hedge fund fees for first time in a decade', 'publication_time': '2024-02-12T14:30:40.880Z'}, uuid=UUID('c867ee05-0dad-4100-90ff-5d9b487a77e3'), db_id=''),\n",

In 2023, 87 ETF providers raised fees on 463 US-listed ETFs vs 64 who imposed cuts.\\nAmong the largest ETF issuers, defined as those with $50bn or more in assets under management, First Trust imposed the largest average fee hike of 0.016 per cent, while Fidelity and Dimensional made the largest cuts of 0.015 per cent and 0.012 per cent respectively.\\nETF investors responded by holding back on investing in funds that raised their fees and increasing flows to funds that cut investor costs.\\nElisabeth Kashner, director of global fund analytics at FactSet and author of the report , focuses on the fortunes of the largest ETFs whose fees increased during 2023: the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF) and the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD).\\nThe funds’ fee calculation rules meant that published expense ratios on the iShares ETFs rose by a minuscule amount from 0.1846 per cent on January 1 2023 to 0.1879 per cent on August 1. However, Vanguard’s equivalent ETFs — the Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF (VONG) and the Vanguard Russell 1000 Value Index ETF (VONV) — grabbed an additional 4.2 percentage points of the four funds’ combined market share.\\n“Fee hikes — or the appearance of such — in 2023 were risky moves,” Kashner writes, noting in the report that the latest gains in market share for Vanguard’s funds, which currently carry expense ratios of 0.08 per cent, add to gains that started to be made in when it began cutting fees in December 2014.\\nDespite the encroachment, however, Vanguard’s share of the four funds’ total assets has only recently crept above the 15 per cent mark.\\n“These holders could be highly trading-cost-avoidant (the iShares spreads are currently just 0.01 per cent vs 0.02 per cent for Vanguard), trapped by unrealised capital gains or brokerage platform restrictions, or simply prone to inertia,” Kashner suggested.\\nTrading volumes on the four funds would suggest that Kashner might be right on the trading cost hypothesis and that the iShares funds are attracting shorter-term holders. Bloomberg’s three-month average daily trading volume data shows that IWD trades almost 10 times more than VONV, while IWF trades six times more than VONG.\\n“IWF and IWD’s trading volumes enable the funds to be used as financial instruments or asset allocation tools for investors to efficiently access and express their views at scale on these market segments,” said Rachel Aguirre, head of US iShares product at BlackRock.\\n“iShares has more than 1,400 ETFs to serve the broadest set of clients — asset owners, asset managers, wealth and individual investors,” she added.\\nThe fierce competition, however, suggests that BlackRock, like all asset managers, will have to continue to focus on investor costs.\\nVisit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings\\n“The ETF market remains fiercely competitive, even as ETFs become increasingly popular with retail investors,” said Shelly Antoniewicz, deputy chief economist at the Investment Company Institute.\\n“According to preliminary data from a forthcoming industry report on fund fees from the Investment Company Institute, overall ETF expense ratios continued to tick down in 2023, for both index and active ETFs,” she added.\\nShe noted that more than $200bn in flows went to US-focused index equity ETFs with expenses ratios in the lowest quartile in 2023.\\nKashner said the numbers were grim reading for ETF issuers, especially anyone planning to enter the fray for the first time.\\n“Asset managers should think twice before getting into this business,” she said. “They face the challenge of developing a winning strategy in a very competitive market.”', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/84ca9fbe-a9ce-4d61-b6d9-424031a25278', 'title': 'Fee pressure intensifies in the US ETF market', 'publication_time': '2024-02-22T05:00:24.718Z'}, uuid=UUID('829f4aa8-d4e4-4d51-ba19-ce2a4a837dda'), db_id=''),\n",

Under the new rules, firms must act in good faith towards customers, avoid causing foreseeable harm, and enable and support customers to pursue their financial objectives.\\n“The data gathering\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009forms part of [our] work to raise standards so people can invest with confidence,” the FCA said in the announcement. “Central to that strategy is ensuring people can access advice if they want it and have trust in the services on offer.”\\nThe FCA has previously warned the retail investment industry that consumers are not always receiving value for money where ongoing services are offered by financial advisers. “We are concerned firms are not adequately considering the relevance, nature and costs of these services for all their clients,” Therese Chambers, director of consumer investments at the FCA, said in December 2022.\\nA year later, during a webinar, the regulator flagged concerns that some consumers might be paying for a service such as an annual review but were not actually receiving it.\\nIn its survey, the FCA asked for information on whether firms had assessed the ongoing services they provide to customers as a result of the Consumer Duty, and whether they had made any changes as a result.\\nIt also asked the companies how many clients they decided should have a review of the suitability of the advice they were receiving as part of their service, and how many had received that review.

       "  (Document(text='\\nSoumaya Keynes\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nI loathe watching a bargain crumble click by click, crushed under the weight of unexpected charges. These irritants are known as “dripped fees” or “junk fees”, but other names came to mind including “situational-monopolist fees”, “too-exhausted-to-resist fees” or, more simply, “chump charges”. The worst ones confuse customers and quell competition. What’s so complicated about getting rid of them?\\nThere are companies keen to stop thwacking their customers with extra charges at the checkout. But a solo move towards all-in pricing will make them seem expensive. The ticketing platform StubHub attempted as much in 2014, but reversed in 2015 after its market share shrank. One study of its experience found that including the 15 per cent booking fee up front slashed revenue by 21 per cent.\\nWith elections looming in both America and Britain, politicians are desperate to show that they have made something cheaper. This week the UK government announced legislation that would ban hidden and unavoidable charges. In America the White House, regulators and state-level legislators are waging a wider war on junk fees they deem “unfair” or “deceptive”. The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a new cap on charges for people going overdrawn.\\nOne challenge is that the term “junk fee” is hard to pin down. The narrowest definition covers unavoidable fixed fees that are presented at the end of a purchase. A $2 booking fee shown at the checkout, for example. The broadest definition sprawls to include any charge that people don’t like, such as late payment, baggage handling or delivery fees. (I would argue that the American practice of adding taxes at the end of a transaction should qualify, but some legislators disagree.)\\nSuppose policymakers took a narrow definition of junk fees. Although regulations could work, companies have a habit of wriggling around new rules. Suppose, too, that the government banned hidden mandatory charges, but allowed companies to shroud add-ons. In a submission to the government, Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority noted retailers’ tendency to apply “charges that are theoretically optional, but which in practice are paid by the majority of their customers”.\\nRemoving all booking fees might look good, until you land on the final payment page to discover a doubled delivery fee. Not to worry though. You can always avoid the delivery charge altogether if you pick up your merchandise from the warehouse in Guangzhou, China.\\nA more expansive definition of junk fees could be a nightmare to enforce. And closing off every loophole might prove overwhelming. What counts as a legitimate unbundling of a service? And what if companies showed the all-in price at the start, but in a tiny font? Or what if you had to scroll down to see it? What if they included the booking fee on the first page, but not on the second?\\nWinning a game of whack-a-mole requires a lot of energy — and a big mallet. The Biden administration is keen to play. Its definition of junk fees seems broader than the British one, and includes late payment fees or overdraft charges, even if they are disclosed when people open bank accounts.\\nIt is possible that squashing fees like this will reduce overall payments by consumers, as seems to have happened in Britain when the Financial Conduct Authority limited unarranged overdraft charges. But Kristen Larson, a lawyer who advises credit unions, banks and fintechs on the regulatory environment, suggests that fees will simply rise somewhere else, redistributing between different types of customer. “Financial institutions aren’t non-profits,” she says.\\nAnother possible unintended consequence of curbing bank account fees is that banks withdraw credit from the people policymakers are trying to protect. An American law passed in 2009 limited credit card issuers from charging certain fees. Although some early evidence suggested no effect, a study published in 2022 found that banks responded by withdrawing credit from subprime borrowers.\\nThe most immediate risk when it comes to regulating junk fees in the US seems to be that over-enthusiasm to clamp down makes a mess. As more state legislatures join in, the chances rise of companies facing a patchwork of rules, only some of which cover, say, taxes or delivery fees.\\nIt is worth levelling the playing field for those businesses that decide they want to be upfront with their customers. If companies roll the fees into other charges, there might not be much of an effect on overall costs. But if shopping becomes much less annoying, I’m sold.\\nsoumaya.keynes@ft.com\\nBid for lunch with Soumaya Keynes and all proceeds go to the FT’s Financial Literacy and Inclusion Campaign charity\\nFollow Soumaya Keynes with myFT and on X', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/68f4226a-4157-41e6-95fe-8f92bce903cc', 'title': 'Why is it so hard to junk junk fees?', 'publication_time': '2024-01-26T05:00:39.337Z'}, uuid=UUID('57e696a4-33f6-4bab-b50d-013cf86ad8e7'), db_id=''),\n",

In recent years they have lowered overdraft fees but still bring in nearly $9bn a year from the charges, according to estimates from the CFPB . Individual overdraft fees can run as high as $39, according to a report published last year by Bankrate.\\nThe CFPB is expected on Wednesday to publish a draft of its proposed fee cap. It will kick off a comment period that will close on April 1. The bureau will not initially propose a specific figure for the cap, which it said could be anywhere from $3 to $14, but rather will seek industry and consumer feedback for what the upper limit on overdraft fees should be. Any cap was not likely to go into effect, if it does, until late 2025 at the earliest, the CFPB said.\\nThe proposal will only apply to banks with more than $10bn in assets, roughly the 175 biggest US lenders . It could ignite a new fight between the banking industry and the CFPB, which financial executives and Republicans have long argued does not have the authority to regulate financial institutions or limit fees.\\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule later this year in a case brought by a group of payday lenders who claim the government’s funding of the CFPB, which was set up after the financial crisis, is unconstitutional.\\nBiden raised the issue of junk fees in his State of the Union speech last year. In October, the Federal Trade Commission proposed a rule to bar companies from showing consumers one price — for a concert ticket or hotel room, for example — only to inflate the final cost of the purchase with extra fees. The CFPB has previously said it would step up its enforcement of existing laws that prevent banks from charging customers excess fees for basic information about their accounts.\\nThe Biden administration had previously indicated that overdraft fees, which consumer advocates have long called excess and abusive, would also be targeted.\\nConsumers are hit with overdraft fees when they attempt to withdraw or spend more money than they have in their accounts. Overdraft was originally a service meant to protect consumers from fees and penalties associated with cheques that bounce.\\nA number of banks have cut their overdraft fees to $10, or eliminated them completely, after complaints and earlier regulatory crackdowns. The average overdraft fee last year was nearly $27, according to data from Bankrate. More than 90 per cent of US checking accounts are subject to overdraft fees.\\nThe CFPB said its new rule could save consumers as much as $3.5bn in fees a year.\\n“Decades ago, overdraft loans got special treatment to make it easier for banks to cover paper cheques that were often sent through the mail,” CFPB director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. “Today, we are proposing rules to close a longstanding loophole that allowed many large banks to transform overdraft into a massive junk fee harvesting machine.”', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/006f31e9-3c55-4bed-8822-b6b49c220ed0', 'title': 'US consumer regulator proposes capping bank overdraft fees', 'publication_time': '2024-01-17T10:00:42.765Z'}, uuid=UUID('9bccea09-5e65-4db6-9815-1b68b9c7baff'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nMoira O’Neill\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nThe UK’s largest wealth manager St James’s Place’s announcement that it will scrap its exit fees is long overdue. But it’s hard to call this either a victory for consumers or an outstanding achievement for the regulator.\\nExit fees are wrong because they are barriers to leaving that allow financial firms to grow complacent. They increase customer inertia, meaning there’s no reason to improve service or innovate products.\\nThese charges, once common across the industry, are generally on the decline but, as SJP demonstrates, they have not gone yet. The blame for delay lies firmly at the door of the Financial Conduct Authority, the regulator, which considered plans to ban exit fees four years ago but then dropped the idea.\\nThe FCA missed a chance to put things right in its Consumer Duty launched in July, watering down the rules to a ban on “unreasonable” exit fees.\\nIn the end, it should be the customer who decides if the fee structure is acceptable. So, if you’re with St James’s Place, think carefully about staying with a firm that is only belatedly caving in to pressure to do the right thing by its customers.\\nSJP has more than 900,000 clients, serviced by 4,766 qualified advisers . Until now, the business has levied an “early withdrawal fee” of up to 6 per cent on pensions and bonds money, reducing on a sliding scale over six years.\\nIn July, SJP’s then chief executive said these exit fees that aren’t called exit fees were not “unreasonable”. After a few weeks and several chats with the regulator, the charges will finally be scrapped. The new man in charge has his work cut out implementing some dramatic changes.\\nBut remember that the barrier won’t be lifted until mid-2025. Before that bond and pension customers will remain on that sliding six-year scale. Rob Dix, author of The Price of Money, says: “The fact that SJP has accumulated £150bn of customer funds with such an uncompetitive fee structure (and limited fund range) suggests many people aren’t confident in asking the most basic questions about how their money is managed.”\\nRecommended\\nSJP says it has a “ substantial programme of system and process changes ” that’s delaying the removal of exit fees. Is it worryingly cumbersome technology or bureaucracy, or perhaps both? Either way it’s hardly reassuring.\\nIf you want to be informed on SJP, a quick internet search will reveal stories about charges, accusations of opulent corporate spending , and underperforming funds .\\nThe investment platform Bestinvest’s “ Spot the Dog” report reveals the funds that have consistently underperformed in each of the past three years and by 5 per cent over the whole period. In the latest edition, who had the highest number of “dog funds”? Yep, it’s St James’s Place. Of the £46.2bn held in the 56 poorest performers, £29.3bn was in six SJP funds.\\nTo be fair, SJP says it is trying to fix underperformance with the recent appointment of a new chief investment officer and director of research.\\xa0The wealth manager says: “We are continually evolving our funds with the aim of driving excellent long-term performance for our clients.” It would do well to offer clients a wider range of funds, not least from better-performing investment groups, and maybe some low-cost passives.\\nDespite all the criticism, SJP continues to rank highly with its customers on reviews website Trustpilot and on adviser search website VouchedFor . It’s a puzzle for me that so many have stayed with the company and new customers continue to sign up.\\nMaybe they are guided by those online reviews? If so, they need to dig deeper.\\nOn the plus side, SJP announced plans to reduce the initial charge on its pension and investment products from a maximum of 6 per cent to 4.5 per cent of assets.\\nHowever, it is tweaking the ongoing charges, also levied as a percentage of assets, so that customers will actually pay a bit more in the first six years and less later.\\nSJP says it’s all simpler now — but it still looks very complicated to me.\\nWhile these fees remain common enough in the industry, the practice is declining, as more go-ahead advisers switch to charging flat fees for work done. They’re responding to customer demand: SJP has missed a chance to follow suit.\\nJames Baxter, founder of wealth manager Tideway Wealth, says: “St James’s Place\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009has a business model that looks like a 1980s Ford Cortina. If someone wants to give you money, you don’t put barriers in the way.”\\nThink carefully about staying with a firm that is only belatedly caving in to pressure to do the right thing by its customers\\nMaybe you still use CDs and video tapes? It’s fine if you do. But some of us have moved to Spotify and streaming services. We like electric cars, not Ford Cortinas.\\nI like to think a\\xa0“modern” customer looks to keep fees low and sees charging up front for new money as archaic — and restrictive. Due to the effects of compounding, initial charges — whether for product or advice — take bigger bites out of your portfolio every year, often wiping out the growth.\\nI think this week’s news might prompt at least a few SJP clients to consider moving out — despite the company’s changes and promises to improve investment performance.\\nBut if you want to leave SJP (or any other financial company that still charges exit fees), you might want to try moving without paying them. Don’t be polite. Some readers report that a strongly worded letter does the trick.\\nIf you do switch, you’ll face the problem of where to move. SJP is by no means the most expensive wealth manager out there, though comparisons are difficult as the information is not always clear. The FCA found in 2020 that the average charges were\\xa02.4 per cent of the amount invested for initial advice and 0.8 per cent per annum for ongoing advice.\\xa0The regulator expressed concern about the level of ongoing charges.\\nEven 2 per cent is enough to wipe out at least 40 per cent of your investment returns over 25 years, if portfolio growth is 5 per cent. I suggest you consult the investment charges impact calculator at website Candid Money .com.\\nSchroders’ 2022 UK Financial Adviser survey found 73 per cent of advisers levy average fees (whether percentage-based or flat) of between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent of assets.

       "  (Document(text='\\nHelen Thomas\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nIn July last year, St James’s Place declared that its long-term partnership with clients and fulsome disclosure meant it didn’t expect any impact from the UK’s latest financial regulation. “We welcome the FCA’s new consumer duty proposals,” said chief executive Andrew Croft.\\nA year later, not so much. The wealth manager to the well-heeled cut its fees for longstanding clients this summer, ahead of the financial regulator’s new rules that focus on “fair value” and “good outcomes” for customers. This week it announced a more drastic overhaul, with plans over the next two years to scrap early withdrawal penalties and to unbundle its all-in fees into separate charges for advice, products and fund management while “realigning” the price of those components.\\nThe shares are down 43 per cent this year. Others trying to figure out how the consumer duty will affect them (or hoping it won’t) should take note.\\nSJP is an early casualty of what is a new era for everyone in financial services. When first proposed, the consumer duty was seen as a slightly fluffy , kumbaya effort that would replace the existing requirement to treat customers fairly.\\nNot any more. The FCA has rammed home the message that the duty, which came into force at the end of July and requires companies to show how they are delivering fair value, is a big change in how they regulate. It is principles-based so what that means will only become clear as examples and ultimately enforcement action arise.\\nSJP offers some early lessons. There is obvious merit in what Fairer Finance’s James Daley calls “radical transparency” . This means actively highlighting your shortcomings, as well as your strengths, in plain English. SJP has always maintained that its combined fees represented decent value. But, even if it did have plentiful evidence for that, they were complicated and made it hard for customers to compare services from alternative providers.\\nIn a sector with plenty of disengaged, excluded and unfairly penalised customers, the duty’s first high-profile beneficiaries are a relatively wealthy bunch: most of SJP’s 1mn clients fit into the “mass affluent” category, with investable assets of between £50,000 and £5mn. Its exit fees were hard to stomach; some funds certainly hadn’t performed well. But the company had reasonable evidence of happy customers. Its retention rate is high at 95 per cent. Its funds under management have more than quadrupled over the past decade. About half its new business comes from existing clients, while more than a third comes via referrals.\\nCustomer satisfaction is not necessarily a guide to good customer outcomes, at least as far as the regulator is concerned. This should prompt others to look again at their consumer duty homework. David McCann at Numis expects the duty will put some fund managers and platforms under price pressure, while bigger or more successful companies may find that operating margins or returns are in effect capped in the name of fairness.\\nThere is a risk here for the regulator that the duty is tagged as anti-success or anti-innovation — something that ends up herding pricing and products into a homogenised range seen as acceptable. The FCA isn’t a price regulator, in the formal sense. But the language in the duty, about a reasonable relationship between the price and benefits of products and services, pushes it further in that direction.\\nOne question is how the rules can accommodate the softer elements of value. Clients shelled out for SJP, in part, because of the fancy Mayfair branding and clubby, personalised approach.\\nBut people pay over the odds for all sorts of things because the marketing or associated status makes them feel special (see: the entire luxury goods sector). Peace of mind may be another source of value. In insurance, however, the FCA suggested in 2015 that peace of mind was highly subjective, often poorly evidenced and didn’t form part of their assessment.\\nUltimately, there still has to be space for fully informed consumers to make what others might see as economically irrational decisions. But those still hoping that the duty is a trifle or a box-ticking exercise have been put on notice.\\nhelen.thomas@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/fa47f6f7-0866-46af-84ef-f0bfe3b7f292', 'title': 'Your happy customers are no match for the UK’s consumer duty', 'publication_time': '2023-10-23T04:00:44.391Z'}, uuid=UUID('fbe4991e-096f-4bfe-9934-7129d98a23a3'), db_id=''),\n",

They have shed 40 per cent of their value since the start of the year.\\nThe FTSE 100 group has faced scrutiny over what critics say are opaque and expensive charges for financial advice and stiff penalties for early withdrawals.\\nInvestors’ concerns over SJP’s business model have intensified since the Financial Conduct Authority introduced “consumer duty” rules in July, which force companies to show they are acting in customers’ best interests.\\nBut the company has been discussing further reforms to assuage regulators’ concerns, according to the people.\\nIt has proposed removing early withdrawal charges for new customers by mid-2025 and simplifying — or “unbundling” — fees for a variety of advisory and administrative services, they said. Executives have been warned by regulators that even these changes may not go far enough, they added.\\nSJP has a complex fee structure involving upfront fees and ongoing annual charges. Some of those recurring charges do not apply during the first six years, but certain clients have to pay early-withdrawal charges — exit fees — if they pull their money during that time.\\nExecutives have been asked to justify keeping exit fees for existing customers while scrapping them for new ones, the people said. Under SJP’s proposals, clients who invested before 2025 would still face early-withdrawal charges, which start at 1 per cent and in some cases can be applicable for the first 11 years.\\nWatchdogs are also concerned about whether high upfront advice costs are in customers’ best interests and whether SJP makes it too difficult for customers to stop paying advice fees further down the line, according to the people.\\nBut SJP has expressed concerns that scrapping exit fees for existing customers could have a significant accounting impact on its balance sheet, the people said.\\nAbout £47bn — 30 per cent — of SJP’s assets under management were subject to exit penalties as of June this year.\\nRecommended\\nOne former insider said regulators had been pushing back against the charging structure for almost a decade, arguing it was anti-competitive because it locked customers in, and that some customers did not understand the fees.\\n“The regulators always had questions about that structure, principally because they thought it disguised the true cost of advice to the customer\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009that issue has always been there.

SJP added that it was engaging with regulators during the process.\\nAsked about regulatory pressure on SJP to evaluate its exit fees, the FCA said it could not comment on dealings with individual firms.\\nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets said on Friday that “our view now tilts to seeing future changes on fees for SJP as probable, which further adds to the uncertainty surrounding the shares”.\\nIf SJP did scrap exit charges for existing customers, it would be the most significant overhaul of the company in its three-decade history.\\nEven without that change, SJP faces having to completely re-engineer its IT systems to reflect the new charging structure — a huge project that has caused tension with the regulator over the slow pace with which the wealth manager is adapting to the new consumer duty, the people said.\\nThe tweak to fees announced in July — a 0.15 percentage point cut to the maximum annual product management fee for 65,000 clients who had been with the firm for more than a decade — could alone take 8 per cent off 2024 earnings, according to UBS estimates.\\nThat announcement knocked 16 per cent off the company’s shares in a single day. David McCann, an analyst at Numis, flagged concerns that the initial fee cut was “just the tip of the iceberg”.\\nSJP’s next moves will be closely watched by the rest of the UK wealth and asset management sector, which is trying to assess just how far-reaching an impact the consumer duty will have on their business models and charging structures.\\nAddressing the FCA’s concerns will be one of the priorities for incoming chief executive Mark FitzPatrick, who briefly served as boss of insurer Prudential. He joined the board this month and is working alongside Andrew Croft on the remediation plan before replacing him in December.\\nIn July, Croft said SJP had “looked at every part of our business through the consumer duty lens and, where changes needed to be made, we have made them”.\\nAdditional reporting by Laura Noonan in London', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1280b319-578e-44d7-b240-1e306c2d1389', 'title': 'UK wealth manager St James’s Place pushed by regulators to overhaul fees', 'publication_time': '2023-10-13T10:24:22.231Z'}, uuid=UUID('4d2ce9ab-09ff-426a-8339-e2e195e4564a'), db_id=''),\n",

The UK annual rate of inflation was 6.7 per cent in September, down from a peak not seen since the 1980s.\\nMid-contract payments are cumulatively expected to climb by £770mn, with increases of £660mn for customers who are out of contract in 2024 — £1.43bn in total — according to analysis by Citizens Advice.\\nIt estimated that prices would rise an average of 9 per cent across mobile and broadband next year. For both contracted and out-of-contract consumers, this would amount to an annual £47 increase.\\nIt also found that telecoms bills for a large number of people would, by April 2023, have cumulatively risen more than 38 per cent since mid-2021.\\nConsumer rights groups, including Which?, have called on Ofcom to ban mid-contract price rises across the telecoms market. Citizens Advice is also demanding the removal of inflation-linked price rises for customers whose agreements have ended.\\nOfcom said it would keep a “close eye” on whether companies were “playing by the rules”.\\n“We’re currently looking at whether tougher rules are needed so that customers can be certain about what they will pay, and at companies’ compliance with our rules,” it added.\\nThe regulator will publish its review in December.\\nBT Consumer said: “We understand that price rises are never wanted nor welcomed but recognise them as a necessary thing to do given the rising costs our business faces.” It added that BT’s price rises were “contracted and transparent”.\\nVodafone UK said the “adjustments we make are essential to help us continually invest in a reliable network throughout the UK, as well as to keep up with the ever-growing demand for data”.

This would have led to less investment, fewer air traffic controllers and a less resilient system with more delays for passengers,” he said.\\nNats, a public-private partnership, is owned by the government, pension funds and a group of airlines. It has apologised for the major disruption caused by its failure over the busy bank holiday, which caused the cancellation of more than 1,500 flights on August 28 and more on subsequent days as airlines tried to recover their schedules.\\nA preliminary report by Nats found that a “one in 15mn” technical failure occurred after a part of its system incorrectly processed a flight plan from an airline that was due to fly over UK airspace. The CAA has launched a review into the collapse.\\nWalker said it recognised “the disruption caused by the technical issue in August and we will consider any further regulatory steps as appropriate following the outcome of the independent review”.\\nNats has a separate, non-regulated business running control towers for airports.

       "  (Document(text='\\nTim Harford\\nOne of the modern classics of economics is an article from 2006 with the self-explanatory title “Paying Not to Go to the Gym”, in which researchers Stefano DellaVigna and Ulrike Malmendier studied the behaviour of nearly 8,000 gym members and found it “difficult to reconcile with standard preferences and beliefs”.\\nBy that, they meant that gym members seemed to be delusional, weak-willed or both. People on a monthly contract paid more per visit than those who simply showed up and paid at the door, suggesting they either had a very basic problem with arithmetic or, more likely, optimistic expectations about how often they would exercise. People on the rolling monthly contract also tended to let more than two months elapse between the last visit and the moment they got round to cancelling their\\xa0membership.\\nFor nerds like me, the article has an important message about the field of behavioural economics . We’ll get to that. There’s also a broader question. The subscription business model has expanded from traditional products, such as newspapers and gym memberships to software, streaming media, vegetable boxes, shaving kits, makeup, clothes and support for creative types via Patreon or Substack. We should all be asking ourselves, if so many people are paying not to go to the gym, what else are we paying not to do?\\nA new working paper from economists Liran Einav, Benjamin Klopack and Neale Mahoney attempts an answer. Using data from a credit and debit card provider, they examine what happens to subscriptions for 10 popular services when the card that is paying for them is replaced. At this moment, the service provider suddenly stops getting paid and must contact the customer to ask for updated payment details.\\nYou can guess what happens next: for many people, this request reminds them of a subscription they had stopped thinking about and immediately prompts them to cancel it. Relative to a typical month, cancellation rates soar in months when a payment card is replaced — from 2 per cent to at least 8 per cent. Einav and his colleagues use this data to estimate how easily many people let stale subscriptions continue. Relative to a benchmark in which infallible subscribers instantly cancel once they decide they are no longer getting enough value, the researchers predict that subscribers will take many extra months — on average 20 — to get around to cancelling.\\nDon’t take the precise numbers too seriously — as with most social science, this is not a rigorously controlled experiment but an attempt to tease meaning out of noisy real-world data. What you should take seriously is the likelihood that you are swimming in barely noticed subscriptions, some of which you would choose to cancel if you were forced to pay attention to them for a few minutes. Perhaps you should. Come to think of it, perhaps I should.\\nBut I promised a geeky lesson about behavioural economics too. Loyal readers will have noted some recent scandals in behavioural science: experiments conducted separately by two well-known researchers, Dan Ariely and Francesca Gino, have been found (in the opinion of independent experts) to contain manipulated or fraudulent data. Both deny wrongdoing.\\nIn the light of this dismaying situation, it would be understandable if people lost a bit of confidence in the field of behavioural economics. So it is worth reminding ourselves of what behavioural economics is trying to achieve. The field has long aimed to bring some psychological realism to economics, whose traditional textbook model has no room for people who take out a gym membership, fail to go to the gym and then neglect to cancel the gym subscription.\\nIts founding member is the co-author of Nudge , Nobel memorial prize winner Richard Thaler . Thaler’s project has always been not to argue that the textbook model is contradicted by laboratory experiments, but that it is contradicted by the way that important markets work in the real\\xa0world.\\nIt is certainly reasonable to ask how many experiments in social psychology may have been fraudulently manipulated. Less outrageous, but of more practical significance, is the possibility that many experiments in social psychology are poorly reported and analysed. As I’ve argued recently, we need to strengthen the foundations of scientific practice to prevent this.\\nEconomists can certainly learn from experiments, but contact with reality should be an important part of economics, which is — or should be — a practical subject.\\nRecommended\\nWhether we are sticking closely to the old textbook model or embracing the latest ideas from behavioural science, our concepts should be taken more seriously when they explain what we see around us every day.\\nIf people really are lazy, short-sighted and inattentive, as behavioural economics suggests, then subscriptions are a hugely attractive business model. The subscriptification of everything suggests that businesses have noticed this.\\nThere are some whimsical ideas in behavioural science, and some of them will not stand the test of time. But the central proposition of Nudge is not whimsical: it’s that the default position matters far more than you’d think, not in a laboratory experiment but in markets where billions or trillions are at stake.\\nPeople delegate life-changingly huge decisions — for example, about contributions to their pensions — to the path of least resistance. If behavioural public policy means anything, it means shaping those default positions for the public good. It’s an idea to which I still subscribe.\\nTim Harford’s new book for children, “The Truth Detective” (Wren & Rook), is now available\\nFollow @FTMag to find out about our latest stories first', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/b2622d99-4eaf-44f7-bbe2-4b61c716a06b', 'title': 'Netflix and bill — the high price of a subscription lifestyle', 'publication_time': '2023-10-06T04:00:27.860Z'}, uuid=UUID('e4695dfa-c07b-4967-b252-af1e4c56a03a'), db_id=''),\n",

They are also being hit by a long-term shift from actively managed assets to passive index funds and competition from cheaper upstart platforms and “robo advisers”, which provide automated financial guidance.\\nHowever, the so-called fund supermarkets have still benefited from money generated on clients’ deposits.\\nPlatforms lend client deposits to banks at the sterling overnight index average rate and pay out a lower interest rate to clients, keeping the difference between the two.\\nFor example, an investor who holds £20,000 of uninvested cash in an ISA wrapper on AJ Bell can expect an annualised interest payment of 2.2 per cent (£440), while the platform could earn £1,040 interest on the money at the current rate of 5.2 per cent.\\nAJ Bell said it managed cash “over the long term using a range of terms and interest rates\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009some of [which] would have been locked in when interest rates were much lower”.\\nHargreaves Lansdown last month beat analysts’ expectations with a bumper set of results after its net interest income for the previous 12 months hit £270mn, up from £50mn the year earlier. The average amount of cash across the year in its investment accounts was £14bn, only slightly up from £13.6bn the year before.\\nHolly Mackay, founder of consumer financial website Boring Money, said that by extrapolating from Hargreaves’ figures it was not “unreasonable to estimate” that the investment platform sector made roughly £690mn over the 12-month period from interest paid by banks on its customers’ cash.\\nAJ Bell said its “recurring ad valorem revenue” — its interest margin plus a 0.25 per cent custody fee on customer assets — was £75mn in the six months to March 31, up 78 per cent on a year earlier.\\nInteractive Investor, which is owned by Abrdn, recorded a £66mn interest rate margin in the first half of 2023, almost half of the group’s operating profit for the period.\\nThe industry has defended its actions, highlighting that customers only hold money on its platforms for short periods and that companies typically pass on most of the benefits of rate rises while keeping customer cash immediately available.\\n“Over 85 per cent of the benefit of base rate rises during the past 12 months has been passed on to clients,” said Hargreaves Lansdown, adding that customers who use its “active savings” products were able to access the top rates offered by high street banks.\\nInteractive Investor said its cash rates were “highly visible” on its website, noting it “continually assesses treatment of interest on cash”.\\n“There can be plenty of circumstances where customers may maintain higher cash balances in the short term,” it added. “We think it is thought-provoking, given we are fundamentally an investment platform, that our rates do not compare unfavourably with many instant-access bank savings accounts.”\\nAnalysts from investment bank RBC noted in September that although earnings had been meaningfully higher at the publicly listed investment platforms, their share price slide had continued.\\n“We have concerns that bloated revenues from this source might make profit growth more challenging as/when interest rates do eventually taper,” they wrote, noting there was also risk from regulation as the issue garners wider attention.\\nHargreaves Lansdown’s share price is down 12 per cent this year while AJ Bell’s has fallen 28 per cent. Abrdn, of which Interactive Investor is just one business segment, is 13 per cent lower.\\nFrederic Malherbe, director of UCL’s Centre for Finance who has previously called for banks to be compelled to pass on the benefits of interest rate rises to savers, welcomed the FCA’s attention on the matter.\\n“Together with some pressure to make transfer of funds in and out the platforms easier, this can only increase the competitiveness of the deposit market in the UK,” he said. “The lack thereof has cost enough to savers in the past 12 months.”\\nThe consumer duty, a standard by the FCA, came into force on July 31 this year and requires asset managers, banks and other companies to prove that they have acted fairly and transparently and delivered “good outcomes” for customers.', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/5a5ab902-b231-4ef5-b8fc-b7143e6d5378', 'title': 'Investment platforms under scrutiny over interest paid on customers’ cash', 'publication_time': '2023-10-17T04:00:12.740Z'}, uuid=UUID('4b08dbfa-91a9-47b6-82ca-ca143a17c2b7'), db_id=''),\n",

The advertised price of a flight soars after baggage fees, seating options and access to “fast track” lanes have been added. But many other retail, hospitality and service businesses are borrowing from this price-inflating playbook.\\nIn fact, close to half of all purchases involve the addition of at least one extra (but necessary) fee, according to an independent study published this week by Alma Economics, a public policy consultancy, that analysed over 500 UK websites and apps.\\nIt found the worst examples of drip pricing were associated with buying event tickets (93 per cent of providers), cinemas (69 per cent) and even gym memberships (60 per cent).\\nOne gym chain pumped up prices with a mandatory joining fee that made up 39 per cent of the base price.\\nIt’s also impossible to tell what many hidden charges are actually for, given the catch-all nature of terms like “admin fee”, “processing fee” or “service charge”.\\nFrankly, “extra profit” would be a more accurate description.\\n“If you knew the final price up front, the question is: would you have a different decision,” says Nick Spyropoulos, Alma’s managing director.\\nOverall, drip fees added a median 6 per cent to the advertised base price, according to Alma .\\nScale this up across the wider online consumer marketplace, and these small yet annoying charges could add up to £3.5bn of additional annual spending — the last thing we need in a cost of living crisis.\\nKeen to crack down on the causes of inflation, the Department for Business has launched a consultation about how best to slow the drip, drip, drip of unfair pricing.\\nI expect they will receive a torrent of replies.\\nNot all the extra charges people resent having to fork out for relate to online purchases. Consider, for example, being stung by “optional” service charges in restaurants of 12.5 per cent or more. Suffice to say, few diners have the chutzpah to ask for this to be removed, even if they receive terrible service.\\nOrdering food via online delivery apps is another area where extra charges added at the end of the process really sticks in the craw.\\nAnd many will have gripes about Airbnb (“the price on the map looks OK, then when you go to book admin fees and cleaning charges are applied”).\\nPlenty of drivers rage about admin fees charged by digital parking apps. Car hire companies upselling expensive insurance add-ons at the last-minute is another thing that drives people mad.\\nAnd even if you haven’t bought a flight, simply dropping someone off at Stansted airport costs an eye-watering £7 for 15 minutes .\\nThese extra charges are clearly something that really annoy people, but the main issue here is transparency. If material pricing information is being withheld, it makes it harder for consumers to compare the true costs, so we risk making a suboptimal purchasing decision.\\nFrom a behavioural point of view, it’s no coincidence these extra charges are dripped in very late in the process. By the time the final price is revealed, psychologically, we’re more committed to buying whatever it is, and thus more likely to proceed (albeit through gritted teeth). Abandoning our basket and starting again also costs more of our precious time.\\nFollowing the consultation, how might ministers try to remedy this?\\nThere’s certainly scope within the existing regulations for the Competition and Markets Authority to crack down on the worst of these charges, but some argue there are too many grey areas, and the rules need to be properly updated for the digital era.\\nCitizens Advice, the independent consumer watchdog, wants to see “new fit-for-purpose regulations and clear obligations for retailers” when it comes to website or app design.\\nFew would agree that the corporate world needs another awards ceremony, but an annual event (The Drips?) to name and shame the most egregious examples is one way consumers could stage a fight back.\\nNomination categories could include The Biggest Drip, Most Pointlessly Named Charge and the Droplet Award for multiple extra pricing add-ons.\\nAnd there wouldn’t be an admin fee charged for handing out the gongs.\\nclaer.barrett@ft.com\\nClaer Barrett is the FT’s consumer editor and the author of ‘ What They Don’t Teach You About Money ’. claer.barrett@ft.com Instagram @Claerb', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/44ae564c-2758-415f-9728-20a8bc092ffb', 'title': '‘Drip pricing’ is a scandal', 'publication_time': '2023-09-08T14:30:50.376Z'}, uuid=UUID('3945031d-cc92-412a-8d25-d845510e483e'), db_id=''),\n",

What has changed? The traditional value investment approach used by many portfolio managers based on “reversion to mean” — the idea that beaten down stocks would eventually rally — has worked poorly in the past 15 years as the US market has focused more on future growth prospects.\\nCompanies that have low price-to-forward earnings ratios are often not undiscovered gems but rather businesses with prospects that may be impaired in some way.\\xa0Conversely, companies that appear to be expensive in absolute terms may not be overvalued given their strong and consistent performance portend future strength.\\nHowever, at some point, the valuation of a stock can become extreme.\\xa0One such current case is Costco, the enormous membership-only retailer. Its stock bottomed out after it posted disappointing earnings in May 2022, but since then it has more than doubled.\\xa0This was partly driven by the fundamental performance of the company but also by investors putting a higher valuation on it. Costco’s forward price-to-earnings ratio has expanded from 31 to a punchy 50 times.\\nWhile many investors appreciate the many merits of Costco’s unique business model with profitability underpinned by fees to use the warehouse club, this strikes me as a lofty increase in valuation for a mature company founded in 1983. A valuation multiple of 50 times forecast earnings seems incredibly high.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nWhy has Costco’s valuation expanded this much? In part it appears due to the expectation of better monetisation of the annual membership fees — akin to a so-called “Netflix Moment” when investors suddenly reassessed the streaming service’s outlook. The improving fee trend would drive bigger profit margins in the future and hence higher valuations.\\nWhile Costco’s net margins have already expanded from 2.4 to 2.8 per cent over the past few years, and this is certainly meritorious of a higher multiple, the question is how likely is it for a stock to maintain a valuation as high as the company’s current premium rating?\\nWe evaluated the precedents of businesses that trade at 50 times price-to-forecast earnings or higher for the first time in a rolling three year period going back to 1999. The recovery periods of 2009 and 2020 saw multiple expansion of this magnitude for many stocks. But on average, there are 20 stocks a year out of the 900 we looked at that reach the valuation threshold. So far in 2024, there have been 19.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nIt is quite consistent that among such companies that their valuation multiples begin to contract on average to 37 times price-to-forward earnings 12 months after the initial “eclipse”. This appears to be the case both before and after Covid-19, excluding the technology bubble and its subsequent bursting.\\nAs the multiples contract, the stocks begin to underperform. The median performance of those stocks that initially eclipse 50 times forward earnings is roughly in-line with the market for the first 10 months but then it begins to lag behind. Since 2003 (so excluding the technology bubble unwind) the median stock lags behind the market by 12 percentage points over the subsequent two years. Only 37 per cent of stocks beat the market over the next two years.\\nIn summary, the data indicates that investors should not immediately panic and sell a stock when it first reaches a price-to-forward earnings ratio of 50 times, but it does appear that the odds of success begin to deteriorate six-to-nine months later. Unless earnings expectations are markedly higher, our advice would be to trim these positions around this time.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nStock examples of companies that initially eclipsed 50 times forward earnings in the past year include Costco, Carvana, Albemarle and Iron Mountain among others.\\nOne important stock in the semiconductor industry Advanced Micro Devices was first valued above the 50 times forecast earnings mark in February 2024.

But controversies such as the rocketing ticket prices for the upcoming Oasis tour and concerns over price gouging mean dynamic pricing is coming under increased scrutiny\\nProduced by FT Studios\\nYou can enable subtitles (captions) in the video player\\nFor years, airlines, accommodation websites, and ride hailing apps have been adjusting their prices in real time, responding to periods of higher and lower demand. It's known as dynamic or surge pricing, but powered by algorithms and artificial intelligence, surge pricing is now being used across a growing number of consumer industries, from theme parks to restaurants, retail outlets, and rock concerts.\\nIn the retail industry, the practise is especially prevalent in online marketplaces. Amazon changes prices 2.5mn times a day across all its product lines, using millions of real time data points to benchmark against competitors and track demand surges. For sellers, dynamic pricing allows a product to have multiple price points, which can lead to increased revenues. A 2018 study by researchers at MIT found that dynamic pricing boosted airline revenues by between 1 per cent and 4 per cent.\\nOne barrier to surge pricing for bricks and mortar retailers has been the time consuming task of physically changing in-store price labels, but the use of electronic labels is rising. In the US, for example, grocery giant Walmart plans to instal them in 2,300 stores by 2026. Its nearest rival, Kroger, began testing the tech in 2018 and has since expanded it to 500 stores across the country.\\nA 2023 report found that dynamic food pricing could increase supermarket gross margins by 3 per cent, but some are wary of the impact it could have on more essential goods like groceries. In August, two US senators announced they would be launching an investigation into Kroger's digital price tags, due in part to concerns the technology will enable price gouging.\\nEven in non-essentials, dynamic pricing is coming under increased scrutiny. This September, ministers in the UK announced plans to probe its use for rock band Oasis's concerts that saw ticket prices skyrocket. For regulators, another concern, across all industries, are the algorithms driving dynamic pricing. They often incorporate competitors' prices, and there is mounting evidence that can encourage implicit collusion between firms, raising prices overall.\\nSurge pricing can also conceal price gouging in markets where there is fixed supply and little transparency. The promise of dynamic pricing is that it better matches supply and demand, producing greater economic efficiencies. But if companies want to use it more widely, their biggest battle may be convincing regulators and consumers that dynamic pricing isn't just a more efficient way of increasing corporate profits.\\nThe best-selling drones in the US are made by DJI in China - some Republican lawmakers plan to ban them\\nWhy Republican women back Donald Trump - despite sexist language, legal troubles, and abortion politics\\nWhy Sequoia and the venture capital industry are up against challenging times\\nThe Uber chief executive on company culture, competing with Amazon, and Elon Musk's robotaxis\\nNext year sees a new train service launch across Italy — La Dolce Vita Orient Express\\nThe mayor of London speaks to the FT about the link between child nutrition and learning, his views of Donald Trump and devolution\\nThe FT’s Myles McCormick looks at how a fluctuating power supply, combined with a low-regulation, business-friendly energy market have created ideal conditions to build battery storage sites\\nGenerative AI is set to reshape the workplace.

The previous low was 1.85 per cent in 2023.\\nIn the past two years, private equity firms have struggled to sell out of their investments. The usual exit routes of stock market initial public offerings and industry dealmaking have been limited by higher interest rates, disagreements about valuations and general economic uncertainty.\\nFirms have returned less money to their investors as a result, in turn leaving those investors with less cash to reinvest in new buyout funds.\\n“Because of that pressure on fundraising, that’s why [buyout managers] are going to make concessions on fees and terms,” said Greg Durst, a senior managing director at the Institutional Limited Partners Association, which represents the industry’s investors.\\n“They’re being very slow and judicious about how they’re going to be making new commitments.”\\nHe added that over the past couple of years, the cash returned by private equity managers to their investors, known as limited partners, has been “way, way off what LPs had grown accustomed to planning around” and that had been “a challenge”.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nIn addition to the difficult fundraising environment, another factor affecting fees is the size of the fund manager.\\nAccording to Preqin, as fund sizes have increased over the past 20 years some of the bigger managers, who receive a larger volume of fees, have chosen to cut their rates. Some smaller firms have cut their fees to try to compete.\\n“Many investors have concentrated on relationships with the largest fund managers,” said one London lawyer who advises mid-market private capital funds. “This means that smaller managers at the lower end of the market are having to work harder.”\\nA lot of the larger firms manage funds across multiple strategies, such as private credit and buyout, and “will offer a fee break across all of them”, said Durst. “If you’re in one, you’re in for a 2 per cent management fee. If you do three, you’re in for 1.75 [per cent].”\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nBigger limited partners also have more leeway to negotiate on fees, according to one London family office manager.\\nThe family office manager, who allocates relatively small amounts of client money to “some of the biggest and most prestigious [private equity firms] on the planet”, said they were not paying less.\\n“I suspect it’s only one category [of investor] paying lower fees and that it’s the big boys who write $25mn to $100mn cheques.”\\nDespite the falls in management fees, buyout fund performance fees — or the share of profits that fund managers get to keep on their successful investments, also known as carried interest — have barely changed, Preqin found.\\nOver the past 20 years, that figure has hovered around an average of 19.5 per cent of fund profits, after a minimum return for limited partners is met.\\nThe Preqin data also shows that there has been no notable downward pressure in management fees for private debt funds.\\nPrivate debt management and performance fees could be lower than for other private asset classes depending on the risk and potential returns, the data provider said.\\nThere has been an upsurge in investor interest in private debt investment.\\nThe Preqin data refers to the management fees for the period in which fund managers are actively investing the capital, usually the first three to five years of a fund.', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/569bfd98-3525-44c5-a811-4640d3b4740b', 'title': 'Private equity management fees fall to lowest level since records began', 'publication_time': '2024-10-22T16:31:30.386Z'}, uuid=UUID('513f3d4e-eb23-4b3e-979c-3c71b4f8c0e3'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nBrooke Masters\\nHell hath no fury like an airline frequent flyer scorned.\\nWhen Delta Air Lines revamped its SkyMiles programme last year, prioritising dollars spent rather than miles flown when handing out upgrades, lounge access and other perks, users lit up social media with their ire. “Stinking odorous sack of scheisse,” was one particularly pungent comment.\\nAmerican Airlines took its turn on the naughty step this spring. Plummeting sales forced it to reverse plans to make corporate travellers who wanted to earn AAdvantage miles book through its website or “preferred” travel agents.\\nNow US regulators are wading into the fray. The US Department of Transportation recently announced a probe of the big four American airline programmes. That comes on top of a scathing report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and complaints from US senators about “abusive, unfair, and sometimes deceptive practices”.\\nHow did a marketing gimmick designed to build customer loyalty in the 1980s after US airline deregulation become such a cultural flashpoint?\\nThese days, frequent flyer programmes are highly sophisticated businesses, more profitable in some ways than the airlines to which they are attached. Delta SkyMiles, the league leader, was worth nearly $27bn last year. The whole airline has a market capitalisation of just $29bn after crippling IT problems this summer. At the height of the Covid shutdowns, several airlines raised badly needed debt by putting up their loyalty programmes as collateral.\\nAlthough loose US rules on credit card transaction fees helped to foster an extensive loyalty system, this is not just a US issue. European airline group IAG makes more money from its loyalty programme than from British Airways.\\nAirlines sell miles to credit card issuers, who use them as rewards to lure affluent customers and convince them to spend more. Co-branding agreements, such as United’s deal with JPMorgan Chase, also include a share of the transaction and annual fees. Compared to ticket sales, it is easy revenue, unaffected by storms and other operational issues.\\nLoyalty schemes have also become more sophisticated about the way customers cash in their miles. Dynamic pricing steers most reward bookings to seats that would otherwise go unsold — maximising profits from point sales — while reserving the most attractive deals for the high-value customers airlines want to keep sweet.\\n“The programmes have become smarter and better run, and some people are bearing the brunt of that,” says Evert de Boer, managing director at consultancy On Point Loyalty.\\nThus I never manage to book reward tickets to anywhere enticing, while my globetrotting attorney friend gets upgraded every time she flies.\\nLife has never been fair, but the Covid pandemic and its aftermath have put the system under extra strain. When travel was curtailed, customers continued to rack up miles on their credit cards. American Express and other issuers offered bonuses to encourage cardholders to put streaming, shipping and goods purchases on their cards. Meanwhile, relatively few miles were being redeemed, and airlines let customers roll over miles and retain perks.\\nAfter lockdowns eased, leisure travel rebounded first, flooding airports with the kinds of customers who make more extensive use of lounges and reward seats. Faced with a crush, the airlines prioritised buyers of expensive tickets and cut benefits they had promised to ordinary cardholders.\\nThe cries of bait and switch reflect just how far these programmes have wormed their way into customer lives. “People get really invested and emotional. When things change\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009it can feel like an affront,” says Tiffany Funk, co-founder of Point.me, a travel reward website.\\nThere is also a competition problem. Many passengers do not have the freedom to change loyalty programmes. An Atlantan has to take a lot of Delta flights if they want to fly nonstop. A Denverite is beholden to United. And credit card companies penalise customers who cancel their cards too soon or too often.\\n“Consumers suffer these harms and don’t have many alternatives because the airline industry has become so concentrated,” says Ganesh Sitaraman, law professor at Vanderbilt University. “That’s why the DoT and CFPB actions are so important.”\\nBut smart executives would not wait for government intervention. Carefully tailored bonuses could do much to rebuild loyalty. Mileage programmes won’t be nearly as lucrative in the future if customers end up loathing the associated airlines.\\nbrooke.masters@ft.com\\nFollow Brooke Masters with myFT and on Twitter', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/246e828d-10c8-44c8-9b63-013e4cd0fab2', 'title': 'The fury of the frequent flyer', 'publication_time': '2024-09-18T04:00:49.419Z'}, uuid=UUID('62119414-3a0a-41c0-90d0-19ffe7c9bafa'), db_id=''),\n",

These fees have in the past attracted less scrutiny than interchange fees because they account for a smaller portion of the charges incurred by sellers.\\n“Every time someone uses a Mastercard or Visa card, UK businesses have to pay fees,” said PSR’s managing director Chris Hemsley. “These fees have significantly increased over recent years, and those increases cannot be explained by improvement in service quality.”\\nHemsley told the Financial Times that the discounts and rebates that Visa and Mastercard gave banks to win contracts gave them an “incentive to try and raise prices [for] retailers”, which consumers ultimately end up paying.\\nOther proposed changes include making the card networks disclose pricing methodologies.\\nHemsley said there were concerns about the transparency and quality of information made available by the card networks, with a PSR review finding “that the market is not working well”. He also said that Visa and Mastercard held information about their fee structure in a way that was not “readily accessible”.\\nThe PSR’s proposals are the latest attempt to loosen the grip of Visa and Mastercard on the payments sector, following complaints about the fees from merchants and retailers, and calls for more competition.\\nTrade bodies, including the British Retail Consortium and the Federation of Small Businesses, have called on the PSR to reduce card fees, with their “Axe the Card Tax” campaign.\\nChris Owen, policy adviser at the BRC, said increases in fees had cost businesses £250mn and urged the regulator to make “meaningful reforms to increase competition, increase transparency and reduce costs”.\\nTina McKenzie, FSB policy chair, welcomed the regulator’s move and said card fees were a burden for small retailers, “taking a bite out of almost every sale, and adding to the financial pressures they face”.\\nVisa and Mastercard say the fees are a reflection of the value of their services, which have in recent years been strengthened by investment in cyber security and network resilience.\\nMastercard said it disagreed with the findings and that the “payments industry has never been more competitive”, while the PSR’s analysis “fails to account for the significant investment required to provide a secure network” that prevents fraud.\\nIt also pointed to a Boston Consulting Group report from 2021 that estimated its scheme fees across Europe as equivalent to 6p on a £50 transaction.\\nRecommended\\nThe company added that it would “continue to work transparently with the PSR” to demonstrate the value it brings to the UK economy.\\nVisa said its fees “reflect the immense value that we provide to financial institutions, merchants and consumers, including extremely high levels of security, near-perfect operational resilience, and a wide range of consumer protections and high-quality products and services that serve consumer and merchant needs”.\\nA parallel PSR investigation of interchange fees last year called for the reintroduction of a cap on interchange cross-border transaction charges , which was scrapped after the UK left the EU.\\nIn the UK, Mastercard faces a class-action lawsuit that claims that the interchange rates it charged between 1992 and 2008 were passed on to consumers by shops and businesses via higher prices. \\u200e\\nIn the US, Visa and Mastercard this year agreed to lower their transaction fees in a $30bn settlement of an antitrust lawsuit brought by merchants .\\nThe PSR was launched in 2015 to regulate payment systems including the ATM network, card payments cheques and bank transfers.

       "  (Document(text='\\nSteve Johnson\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nFee compression may finally be reaching the lucrative indexing industry with global revenues rising less rapidly than fund industry assets last year.\\nWorldwide revenues for the increasingly influential index providers rose 9.3 per cent to a record $5.8bn last year, according to estimates from Burton Taylor International Consulting, a research and advisory group focused on capital markets.\\nHowever, this was comfortably below last year’s 15.5 per cent rise in the assets of open-ended and exchange traded funds (excluding money market funds) globally, according to figures from Morningstar Direct.\\nThe drop in index revenue in relation to fund assets represents a break from recent years, with global index revenues having risen at a five-year compound annual growth rate of 11 per cent, according to Burton Taylor, faster than the 8.5 per cent five-year CAGR of investment assets, based on Morningstar data, even taking into account 2023.\\nAsset managers have long complained that index providers are taking an ever-larger slice of the revenue pie. While fund management fees have fallen precipitously in recent years, particularly for passive index-tracking ETFs, the sums asset managers in turn pay to index providers have not fallen anywhere near as fast, if at all.\\nFunds typically pay an annual fee equivalent to about a couple of basis points of assets to an index provider for the right to track or benchmark against a proprietary index. Alternatively their parent companies can pay flat-rate subscription fees for access to a bundle of indices and other services.\\nAs a result of this mixed payment model, growth in index fees is likely to undershoot growth in assets during years when markets rally strongly. However, Brad Bailey, research director at Burton Taylor, believed index fees were genuinely starting to fall.\\n“There has been considerable cost pressure. We are seeing competition in the index business in terms of fees. These fees really have to go down,” said Bailey, who believed investment bank and hedge fund groups were emerging as competitors to the stock exchanges and specialised index providers that have traditionally dominated the industry.\\n“The economics are shifting” with “increasing index revenues bringing newer providers to the table, pressuring fees downwards”, Bailey added.\\nIn particular, smaller index providers offering “more attractive pricing” have prompted asset managers to “rethink their previous aversion to lesser-known providers”, he said.\\nMore broadly, “the index business has just exploded”, Bailey added, with asset managers launching a panoply of thematic and environmental, social and governance-based funds that require ever more specific indices.\\nBailey added that the movement of indices to areas such as private equity, real estate and credit were also providing fresh sources of revenue for indexers.\\nDespite the growth of some smaller providers, just three groups — MSCI, S&P Dow Jones Indices and FTSE Russell — accounted for 70.3 per cent of index fees last year, according to Burton Taylor.\\nMSCI overtook S&P to claim top spot in 2023, with particularly strong growth in its ESG indices pushing overall revenues 11.4 per cent higher to $1.5bn.\\nNasdaq, the fourth-largest player, has seen revenues rise at five-year CAGR of 20.7 per cent, taking its market share to 9.1 per cent last year, aided by growing appetite for many of the stocks listed on its tech-heavy exchange, headed by the so-called Magnificent Seven.\\nAmong smaller players, Morningstar’s five-year CAGR is 34 per cent, taking its market share to 1.1 per cent, helped by its acquisition of ESG specialist Sustainalytics in 2020. Morningstar’s ESG-related revenues surged 133 per cent last year, according to Burton Taylor’s numbers.\\nGermany’s Solactive, which offers “a disruptive pricing model charging clients a flat fee”, according to Bailey, has chalked up a 20.8 per cent five-year CAGR, with its market share also now 1.1 per cent.\\nThose that have lost market share over the past five years, while still seeing rises in nominal revenues, include Deutsche Börse’s ISS Stoxx, which operates the Euro Stoxx and Dax families of indices; Alerian, best known for its master limited partnership index; and Bloomberg, which nevertheless remains number one for fixed income indices, narrowly ahead of FTSE Russell for this category.', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/c7be636d-3aa7-4a07-843c-add988066dd2', 'title': 'Lucrative index industry might finally be feeling the squeeze', 'publication_time': '2024-05-17T04:00:56.565Z'}, uuid=UUID('50286b68-64ff-4bb7-849e-5cc5bafaf748'), db_id=''),\n",

In the same period, HMRC answered only 67 per cent of calls from taxpayers, compared with a target of 85 per cent.\\nAltogether taxpayers spent 7mn hours, or 798 years, on hold to HMRC in 2022-23, the latest year for which full data is available — more than double the time in 2019-20, according to the NAO.\\nHMRC had not met its goals for responding to taxpayer correspondence or telephone calls for several years, with annual targets last achieved for correspondence in 2018-19 and for telephone services in 2017-18.\\n“In the face of funding pressures, HMRC has pressed on with attempts to reduce costs despite its poor performance. HMRC and customers have been caught in a declining spiral of service pressures and cuts,” the report concluded.\\nHMRC spent £881mn on customer service in 2022-23, a 6 per cent real-terms cut since 2019-20, the NAO said. It noted that the Treasury — to which the tax agency reports — had in 2021 asked HMRC to make annual efficiency savings of £75mn in customer services by 2024-25.\\nLast year the Treasury doubled that target to £149mn, but HMRC has struggled to make the original one. The NAO found the tax authority had made just £53mn of savings by 2023-24.\\nThe watchdog also said HMRC had cut its frontline customer service workforce by 6 per cent in 2023-24 compared with 2022-23, to 18,200.\\nCustomer service staff numbers had fallen by 9 per cent since 2019-20 — when they totalled 20,000 — during which time “call-handling performance worsened significantly”.\\nAs of last month, HMRC planned to slash its frontline customer service workforce, including temporary staff, by 14 per cent in 2024-25 “to live within its customer service budget”, the NAO said.\\nIt warned this reduction would be “unprecedented in recent years” and recommended HMRC rethink its approach.\\nIn March, chancellor Jeremy Hunt ordered HMRC to reverse course a day after the tax agency said it would permanently cut the number of telephone lines available to provide taxpayers with help for self-assessment tax returns, VAT and pay-as-you-earn issues.\\nThe NAO report echoes the influential House of Commons public accounts committee, which said in February that HMRC customer service was at an “all-time low” and that the Treasury had failed to give it sufficient resources.\\nThe Treasury on Monday set out £51mn of new funding to improve the performance of HMRC’s customer service helplines.\\nHMRC said: “While customer service standards on our phone lines are still not where we want them to be, we’re making strong progress in our efforts to improve our customer service and additional funding has been confirmed by the government this week.\\n“Millions more people used our highly rated online services last year — saving them waiting on the phone and freeing up our advisers to deal with those people who need extra support,” it added.', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1f9f7b78-8e15-4a07-be00-99275905db71', 'title': 'Taxpayers spent ‘800 years’ on hold to HMRC, says UK spending watchdog', 'publication_time': '2024-05-14T23:05:03.081Z'}, uuid=UUID('17421cd9-ee50-464c-bc4a-6bd6922cb7fc'), db_id=''),\n",

That was far more than the $1mn the bank took in additional interest from its loans and investments in the same period.\\nJPMorgan Chase and Citi also paid out more to depositors than they took in additional interest last quarter — about $350mm each. In the previous quarter, the two banks took in $2.3bn more in additional interest above what they paid depositors.\\nAt Bank of America, rising deposit costs equalled two-thirds of new interest received in the quarter.\\n“Regardless of what happens to rates, deposit costs are going to continue to rise,” said Greg Hertrich, who is the head of US depository strategies at Nomura.\\n“Traditionally, the way it has worked is that your deposit base usually came from your same metropolitan area. But in today’s environment, the vast majority of deposit rates are advertised to a much wider audience than they used to be.”\\nAfter two years of climbing, the extra amount banks are having to pay out to keep depositors has started to slow. Deposit costs were up an average of 5 per cent in the first three months of the year, compared with the previous quarter, at BofA, Citi, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, to $1.5bn. That is down from a 13 per cent jump in the fourth quarter, and 38 per cent a year ago.\\nThe problem is that, with rates seemingly at their peak, the interest payments the banks are collecting from their loans and investments has nearly stalled. In the first three months of this year, interest revenue at the same four banks rose on average less than one half of one per cent, up about $500mn, from the quarter before.\\n“Lending demand has not rebounded at the level they had hoped,” said Hertrich.\\nThe banks still retain the vast majority of the interest they collect, paying out just 26 per cent of those revenues, on average, to depositors in their most recent quarter. On average, the nation’s biggest banks pay an average interest rate of 2.9 per cent to depositors, up from 1.8 per cent a year ago, but still well below the Fed’s short-term official interest rate of 5.5 per cent.\\nJPMorgan executives said that the bank’s drop in interest income in its most recent quarter, the first time that has happened in nearly three years, was largely because of rising pressure to pay depositors more.\\n“As we’ve been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend,” JPMorgan’s chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum told analysts on the bank’s first-quarter earnings call. “We continue to capture that money-in-motion at a very high rate.”', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/b4779ea4-ddaa-4536-b3c7-2ec0094ee141', 'title': 'Banks pay savers more as ‘higher-for-longer’ rates hit interest income', 'publication_time': '2024-04-28T09:00:11.543Z'}, uuid=UUID('d8f921d0-0f88-4488-b315-ab67dbe4870f'), db_id=''),\n",

Globally, one in three of the businesses that do not currently operate loyalty schemes will do so by 2027, says consulting firm Gartner. Companies that have long offered programmes are also sweetening the rewards. US retailer PetSmart added premium tiers to its loyalty scheme this month.\\nWhat appears good for shoppers has perks for investors too. An academic study based on 322 companies with loyalty programmes found both long and short-term benefits. Sales rose 7 per cent on average in the first year of a scheme’s introduction and gross profits 6 per cent, according to the 2019 research by academics from Michigan State and Oakland universities in the US.\\nAt their simplest, loyalty programmes offer a pact with consumers: keep coming back to us, leaving a data trail each time, and in return you will receive points that can be swapped for goods and services.\\nTheir very longevity implies effectiveness. Frequent-flyer points have been around since the 1970s. Trading stamps, a precursor, began life in the late 19th century. So, too, does the increasing complexity of many schemes, with different tiers and discounted prices. The addition of membership fees is also increasing. These have been found to increase usage.\\nYet some schemes have started to attract unwanted attention. The UK’s competition watchdog has launched a probe into loyalty cards at two of the country’s biggest supermarkets — Tesco’s Clubcard and Sainsbury’s Nectar — over concerns of “two-tier” pricing. The former has more than 20mn members, the latter 18mn-plus. In the US, the Department of Transportation is looking into frequent-flyer programmes at major US airlines.\\nAny effort to restrict programmes is likely to be unwelcome for shareholders, although in the case of supermarket schemes that offer special prices for loyalty card holders, they have already achieved the aim of increasing market share.\\nSome airlines, selling air miles to credit card providers, have turned points into a bigger money-spinner than the far more volatile business of flying.\\nLoyalty programmes feed through to the bottom line in several ways. First, repeat custom is cheaper than bringing new customers on board. That story is told most graphically by the massive cash burn at consumer-facing start-ups as they woo customers with freebies and steeply discounted goods or services. Even the relatively mature Deliveroo spent 9 per cent of revenues on sales and marketing last year.\\nThe troves of data on spending habits garnered by providers helps them to cross-sell and provide tailored deals: for instance, marketing ready meals to a buyer of newborn nappies or plant-based burgers to vegan shoppers.\\nGranted, this can go wrong on occasion. One notorious example is when Target of the US used predictive analytics on shopping patterns to work out pregnancies and even due dates, and sent off baby coupons to a teenager who had not disclosed her condition to her father.\\nThese data caches can also be monetised by selling them on — in anonymised format — to third parties. Sainsbury’s expects its Nectar360 business, which runs its loyalty programme, to generate £90mn of incremental profits by March 2026. US bank JPMorgan, although not actually selling the data, is charging brands to target their ads at its retail customers based on their spending history.\\nThat suggests shoppers should not be the only ones watching their points accumulate, as more companies spin out the concomitant data into its own money-making unit.\\nSupply disruptions have sent cocoa bean prices to remarkable heights. Chocolate makers are melting. Shares in the world’s largest, Switzerland’s Barry Callebaut, have lost a third since the start of 2023.\\nSome relief arrived for the group’s investors this week with better than expected first-half results . Yet commodity volatility means the sweet taste is unlikely to last long.\\nThe biggest concern for investors, of course, is consumers buying less chocolate .\\nTraditionally, that has not been a problem at Barry Callebaut. It is well known for its inelastic demand even though its prices have been rising for years. Its prices are up some 20 per cent since the start of 2021. Volumes over that time have been flat. Surprisingly, volumes remained resilient in the six months to February, rising 1 per cent.\\nElsewhere, there are definite signs of strain. Working capital in particular is squeezed. This jumped by SFr800mn over the six months and contributed to negative free cash flow of SFr1.1bn. As a result, net debt jumped to SFr2.6bn — almost three times ebitda. Barry Callebaut has refinanced its debts and expanded revolving credit facilities.\\xa0It aims to offset the impact of higher bean prices with cost savings.\\nCocoa prices may remain high even though fears of inadequate supply look overblown. A stocks-to-use ratio of more than 30 per cent is high compared with the previous bull market in 1977 when that figure fell to 18 per cent, notes Jonathan Parkman of broker Marex.\\nThe cocoa market has since evolved. Big chocolate makers now seek premium grades to make good on sustainability promises.\\xa0Spot prices are stuck at record levels because of producers’ fears of running out of the right kinds of higher-quality beans. On top of that, buyers are staying out of forward markets in Ghana due to the country’s financial crisis and debt default.\\nBoth factors will keep spot prices higher for longer. This will continue to drip debt on to chocolatiers’ financials.', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/56db7f30-2d63-451a-81bd-e3743f5ffe96', 'title': 'Loyalty schemes pay for shoppers and shareholders', 'publication_time': '2024-04-12T11:00:49.334Z'}, uuid=UUID('fa5c56f3-48f8-42d9-8dd5-48cca90c190a'), db_id=''),\n",

But it is department stores, rather than lenders, that may have most to lose as the credit cycle sours.\\nThe biggest of these — Macy’s, Nordstrom and Kohl’s — do not own their credit card portfolios. But all three generate surprisingly big chunks of their operating income from profit-sharing agreements with their partner banks. For years, the income stream has helped prop up a retail business model that is now well into its third decade of sustained decline.\\nThis lifeline is at risk — yet all three stocks are trading at or above their three-year averages on a forward earnings basis. Constant takeover interest in the sector helps. Investors should take a hard look at the core retail business and reset their expectations accordingly.\\nUS department stores offer all kinds of perks to get customers to sign up for their branded credit cards at the register. Store cards, with their high interest charges and late fees, turn out to be far more lucrative than running a brick-and-mortar store.\\nCredit cards accounted for less than 5 per cent of total sales at the three companies in 2022. But they made up 87 per cent of Nordstrom’s total operating income in 2022 and 55 per cent of Macy’s, according to Citigroup. At Kohl’s, they generated 381 per cent of total operating income, meaning without credit cards, the company would have made an operating loss.\\nLate fees are a big money spinner. These can be as high as $30 per payment at the moment. But a new rule passed last month could cap them at $8.\\nAnalysts at Bank of America think late fees represent between 14 per cent and 30 per cent of the companies’ credit card revenue. A cap on fees could result in a 29 to 68 per cent drop in earnings per share at Kohl’s this year, and under half that at Nordstrom and Macy’s.\\nRising delinquencies as well as faltering retail sales growth will add to the pressure. Kohl’s suggested last month that it could take a $250mn to $300mn hit to its annual credit card revenue as a result of the late fee cap. The retailer said there were levers it could pull to offset this, such as growing its co-branded credit card business.\\nYet a struggling retail sector overly dependent on these cards will unlikely find the answer by opting for more credit business.\\npan.yuk@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Effect of increased fees on customer retention', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/2cf2b3bd-396f-48a6-93b8-069a4fbe78b4', 'title': 'Why US department stores have most to fear as credit card debt sours', 'publication_time': '2024-04-05T09:09:13.776Z'}, uuid=UUID('0d896075-bd3f-4062-816f-28fea687ce4d'), db_id=''),\n",

But it is not cost-free.\\nIn the US, merchants paid a record $172bn in processing fees to accept $11.2tn in card payments last year, according to the Nilson Report. The bulk of those so-called swipe or interchange fees — about 79 per cent — was from credit cards.\\nA landmark class action settlement this week wants to change that. Visa and Mastercard — the country’s two biggest card payment processors — have agreed to lower the fees that merchants pay to accept credit card payments. Under the proposed deal — which must be approved by a judge — these fees will be reduced by at least 0.04 percentage points for a minimum of three years and capped for five years.\\nRetailers say the settlement would save them $30bn over five years. But investors in Visa and Mastercard can rest easy. Their high-margin business model remains intact.\\nVisa and Mastercard set interchange rates, which can average between 2-4 per cent of the transaction amount. But they only get a small slice of this. In a $100 purchase, for example, a shop might pay 2.5 per cent — or $2.50 — in fees to accept a credit card payment. Of this, Visa or Mastercard, which operate the networks that connect cardholders with banks and merchants, collect perhaps 20 cents. The lion’s share of that fee — about $1.80 — goes to the bank that issued the credit card that is being used. Another 50 cents is collected by the merchant acquirer, or companies such as Block or Stripe that provide the shop’s point-of-sale service system.\\nThe settlement does not specify from whose cut the 4 bps decrease in interchange fees will come. The odds are it will be coming from card-issuing banks such as JPMorgan, Citigroup or Bank of America rather than Visa or Mastercard.\\nBanks have plenty of ways to offset lower interchange fees. They can make up the revenue shortfall by raising annual card membership fees and interest rates, or roll back rewards for cardholders.\\nUnder the settlement, merchants are not required to pass on the savings from lower fees to consumers. They can also charge different prices to consumers based on which credit card they use. Credit card holders accustomed to fancy perks are in for a rude awakening.

Synchrony Financial, which provides cards for stores such as JC Penney and American Eagle Outfitters, has gained 45 per cent. Capital One Financial, which is buying rival Discover Financial Services, is up 50 per cent.\\nAmericans held more than $1.1tn on their credit cards at the end of 2023, an all-time high. Nearly 10 per cent of this balance was in serious delinquency (defined as 90 days or more late), according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\\nMore alarming is the rate at which people are becoming seriously delinquent. This surged to 6.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, up from just over 4 per cent at the end of 2022 and the highest level in more than a decade.\\nThe stress is most acute for younger borrowers and those with poor credit scores.

Talent agents and Hollywood unions said Netflix kept that information closely guarded — in contrast with the public releases of Nielsen ratings for traditional TV.\\nSarandos said the new data releases were not driven by the strikes but should create “a better environment for the [Hollywood] guilds, for the producers, for creators and for the press”.\\nHe added that the information being released “is the data that we use to run the business — this is the exact same pool of data that we’re sharing”.\\nJeremy Zimmer, chief executive of the talent agency UTA, had long argued that Netflix and other streamers would have to become more transparent, and that this would be better for writers, actors and producers.\\n“Netflix has waited to release this data until the benefit was greater than the liability,” Zimmer told the Financial Times. “Nonetheless, it’s great to have it available for our clients and it will allow us to create more value on their behalf.”\\nLast year Netflix launched an advertising-based version of its streaming service, although the data release is not aimed at helping advertisers target audiences. “We use third-party reporting because that is the traditional way advertisers verify viewing for payment,” Sarandos said.\\nRecommended\\nBrian Wieser, principal at advertising consultancy Madison and Wall, said the new data is “not very usable from an advertiser perspective.”\\n“This is more useful for Hollywood in general than advertisers,” he said.\\nNetflix began disclosing more about its shows’ performance in 2021, when it started releasing its weekly Top 10 and Most Popular lists.

       "  (Document(text='\\nChristopher Grimes in Los Angeles\\nSome of Netflix’s competitors are reversing a streaming war tactic by licensing their old TV shows and movies to the streamer — boosting its programming offerings but also potentially squeezing its profit margins, analysts say.\\nNetflix relied heavily on programming that it licensed from other companies when it launched its streaming service in 2007. But after Walt Disney, NBCUniversal, Paramount and the then Time Warner launched their own streaming services, they pulled many of their shows from Netflix to avoid feeding a company that had grown into an arch-competitor.\\nWith legacy media groups under pressure to produce streaming profits, however, licensing revenue is looking attractive again — even if it comes from Netflix. This summer, Warner Bros Discovery’s HBO network began licensing a handful of older shows to Netflix, including Insecure , Six Feet Under, Ballers and Band of Brothers.\\n“Conventional wisdom of the last 10 years was that you keep everything in house,” said Casey Bloys, HBO’s chief executive, at the recent Code conference. “But in the history of television, syndication — selling a show somewhere else — was the brass ring. It meant the show was successful and would have a life elsewhere.”\\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley said the return of licensing deals was a “long-term positive” for Netflix and would “pad” its lead over competitors in streaming. But the bank added that the cost of licensing — along with the Netflix’s investments in gaming and other sectors — could add pressure to its profit margins in 2024. The analysts raised their outlook for Netflix’s overall cash spending next year by $500mn to $17.7bn.\\nNetflix will report results on Wednesday, with investors expected to focus on whether it plans to increase subscription prices and signs of progress on its new advertising tier. The latest data on its password sharing crackdown will also be watched.\\nThe return of licensing deals has coincided with strikes in Hollywood, which halted production of new shows and are expected to delay TV and movie releases well into next year. The Writers Guild of America reached a deal with the studios in September after five months, but the SAG-AFTRA union representing actors is still on strike. Those talks collapsed last week after the union asked for a share of subscriber revenue from streamers, studio officials say.\\nDespite the gloom around the strikes, the studios’ experiments with licensing deals appear to have given some old shows new life. After NBCUniversal licensed its show Suits — which aired from 2011-19 and starred Meghan Markle — to Netflix in June, the show experienced a revival. The legal drama was in the top spot on the Nielsen Streaming top 10 for three months, an example of the “Netflix effect” on older shows.\\nBloys said licensing shows to Netflix had also boosted traffic for the programmes on Warner Discovery’s Max streaming platform, home to HBO programming including Ballers , a sports drama that ran from 2015-19. Ballers entered the Nielsen top 10 after it went to Netflix, and Insecure , a comedy starring Issa Rae that ran from 2016-21, had a similar boost.\\n“Without doing a thing on Max, the engagement on Ballers and Insecure really saw a spike when they were on Netflix,” he said at the Code conference. “The initial experiment we had with a couple of titles has had an immediate positive impact on Max.”\\nThere are limits, Bloys added, naming two popular HBO shows that may remain off-limits on Netflix. “I doubt you’ll see Succession or White Lotus , he said.', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/fd84f6bb-b3e1-4691-9b90-f6f90c16bae6', 'title': '‘Netflix effect’ returns as studios license old shows to their streaming rival', 'publication_time': '2023-10-17T04:00:12.781Z'}, uuid=UUID('125df3a0-9f65-4993-be9c-78243af715e9'), db_id=''),\n",

There is always a challenge with finding people online.”\\nThe Premier League’s fight against piracy is especially important in protecting the value of media rights, the lifeblood of the competition and the main revenue generator for football clubs. The league is gearing up to hold the auction for its UK rights, which it previously sold for about £5bn over three years.\\nThe UK’s Intellectual Property Office estimated in February that 3.9mn people illegally watch live sport.\\nA separate survey, conducted by YouGov Sport for sports media company Unofficial Partner, found that more than 40 per cent of people who use illegal means to watch live sport cited the cost as their primary motivation. To follow all the league’s games would require access to Sky Sports, TNT Sports and Amazon’s Prime Video, costing roughly £70 a month.\\nIn July, the FT revealed that Sky had won a High Court order to force internet service providers to block pirates from illegally streaming football matches and television series. That order bears similarities to the Premier League’s so-called “Super Block”, which helped the competition take down more than 600,000 illegal live streams last season.\\nPlumb said this “Super Block”, as well as private prosecutions, are aiding the league’s efforts against illegal streams. Recently-announced prison sentences are another deterrent, he added.\\nAlthough fans still use free websites that rely on advertising to watch Premier League matches illegally, pirates have shifted to using hijacked smart TV devices or “sticks” and collecting subscription fees.\\n“When I first started doing this, our top line priority would have been pubs,” said Plumb. “There’s a little bit of that now but\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009piracy has evolved from peer-to-peer streaming to closed network subscriptions.”\\n“You went from the pub to the teenagers in their bedrooms to families watching in their living room, and that then becomes a real priority for us,” he added.\\nHis comments come after five men were sentenced in May to more than 30 years in prison for running illegal streaming networks.

The result was a 5.9mn bump in subscriber numbers in this year’s second quarter that was hailed as a show of strength by some analysts. But this is only a temporary fix.\\nLike ride-sharing company Uber, Netflix priced its streaming service at low rates to attract the biggest audience possible. Like Uber, it was then bombarded by rivals willing to spend large sums to compete. Six years ago, Netflix claimed that its only real competition was sleep. Now it includes comparisons to streaming competitors in its shareholder letter.\\nAs its shareholders grow weary of subsidising online services, prices are rising. NBCUniversal’s Peacock just lifted its cheapest monthly rate by $1 and Disney+’s US revenue per subscriber has picked up by 20 per cent in the past year.\\nThis means Netflix’s increases do not stand out. It is still the sector leader with nearly 239mn subscribers and expects another increase this quarter. But Netflix must spend more on marketing to draw in those subscribers.\\nLower costs are temporary too. In a repeat of the shutdowns that occurred during Covid-19 lockdowns, the Hollywood writers’ strike has stopped production of films and TV shows. That means Netflix will spend less on content. Free cash flow is expected to be at least $5bn this year, up from $1.6bn in 2022. Long-term debt has come down as well to $14.1bn from $14.9bn two years ago. One can sense that the focus is on level-headed financial decisions just by the near total lack of chatter about video games — an expensive endeavour that Netflix is also involved in.\\nBut when all of the users who were sharing passwords pay up or leave, Netflix will have to find new sources of revenue growth. Advertising subscriptions are not yet large enough for Netflix to choose to put a number on them. It is also a crowded field. Everyone, from YouTube to Uber, now tries to attract ad dollars.\\nIf Netflix wants to keep its focus on tweaking payments it could remove monthly subscriptions altogether and reduce churn by offering only annual or 18-month plans. Month-by-month payments were once a way to distinguish streaming from cable TV. That differentiation is no longer necessary.\\nListen to Lex deputy editor Elaine Moore talk to creators, companies and critics about the next era of social media in the FT’s new Tech Tonic podcast series .', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/6c76b102-d012-4abd-96d7-54124f7235ef', 'title': 'Netflix: password sharing cutback provides shortlived gain', 'publication_time': '2023-07-20T10:36:06.458Z'}, uuid=UUID('10eb5c8d-c8f5-4509-8205-789acfdd9cc7'), db_id=''),\n",

OnLive debuted more than a decade ago, declaring that any internet connected device could become a gaming interface.

This dwarfed the SKr1bn of operating profit from the core Nordic business last year.\\nThis picture is not expected to improve . Viaplay said on Monday that losses at its international business could widen this year to SKr1.5bn compared with a previously forecast loss of SKr1bn to SKr1.1bn.\\nViaplay had hoped its offering would prove “very resilient” to wider problems in the streaming market.

       "  (Document(text='\\nChristopher Grimes\\nWhen Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings declared in 2016\\xa0“we love people sharing” accounts, the company had a commanding lead in the streaming business and four years of blistering growth ahead of it. No one had yet heard of Disney Plus or the streaming wars.\\nBut after the platform lost subscribers early last year, Hastings called time on this breezy attitude towards password sharing, which has given rise to an estimated 100mn Netflix freeloaders around the world.\\nIn recent days, the company has launched password crackdowns in the US, UK and more than 100 other countries. In the US, it has told customers that if they want to share their password, they must pay $7.99 a month to add a person outside their home, or $6.99 if they are prepared to have an account with adverts.\\nThe crackdown plus the new push into advertising reflect the tough realities of the streaming business model that Netflix pioneered. In the boom times, investors were willing to overlook eight- or nine-figure quarterly losses as long as subscription growth was strong. Now, however, new sign-ups have slowed and competition is intense. In the US, the average household has 5.5 streaming subscriptions, notes Jennifer Chan, global strategic director at research group Kantar.\\n“Overall household streaming penetration hasn’t changed very much since the end of Covid,” Chan said. “So the focus for streamers now is on retaining their current customer base and becoming the priority subscription so that consumers aren’t cancelling — and if they are, how do you win them back.”\\nInvestors meanwhile want to see a path to profitability, putting serious pressure on most of the major streaming services to slash costs and come up with new strategies to generate cash.\\nNetflix is profitable, but Disney Plus, Paramount Plus and NBCUniversal’s Peacock are still racking up hefty losses. Warner Bros Discovery, which aggressively cut costs after the companies were combined in a $40bn merger last year,\\xa0recently told investors it expected to turn a profit in its streaming business a full year ahead of schedule and that this part of the business made $50mn in profit in the most recent quarter.\\nLike Netflix, Warner has been making big changes to its streaming service. On Tuesday it\\xa0combined its HBO Max service — home of Succession , White Lotus and Game of Thrones — with Discovery Plus, which specialises in low-cost unscripted programming such as 90-Day Fiancé . The combined service was renamed Max, and the company hopes the broader offering will increase customer numbers and engagement.\\nDisney chief executive Bob Iger plans a similar move later this year by merging child-friendly Disney Plus and Hulu, which focuses on general entertainment aimed at adults, into one app. Iger said this would boost sales of Disney’s with-adverts subscription packages, another step towards reaching its goal of turning a profit in streaming next year. In the meantime he must also address investor worries about subscriber growth — the company’s streaming services have lost customers for the past two quarters.\\nNetflix may face similar problems of retaining customers as it cuts password sharing options. In early trials, Netflix said some users dumped the service, with as many as 1mn cancellations in Spain alone, according to Kantar. While many return — either adding new accounts or opting for the cheaper ad-supported version — there is still some risk, Chan says.\\n“If people are to cancel their subscription, they will be exposed to life without Netflix” and perhaps switch to other services, she said. “I think people will come back, but they may not regain their whole subscriber base.”', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a85f2d38-1889-4108-92af-525ed924b133', 'title': 'Netflix is taking a necessary risk in tackling its 100mn freeloaders', 'publication_time': '2023-05-26T04:00:49.086Z'}, uuid=UUID('936f816e-522c-4318-a60e-8bd9e7f1fd9d'), db_id=''),\n",

But it is the racing series’ in-house streaming experiment that is quietly building traction and increasing revenues for the sport.\\nFive years since the launch of F1 TV, the sport’s direct-to-consumer broadcast product is boosting its media rights revenues by attracting millions of subscribers eager to keep up with events throughout the season.\\nF1 TV has increased its global reach by expanding into 186 markets. But the Pro version, which carries live race streams, is available in just 87.\\nIt represents a shift from traditional broadcasting models, forming a key component of the sport’s growth strategy under US owners Liberty Media , which took control of F1 in an $8bn deal in 2017.\\nMajor markets such as Brazil, Mexico and the US are among countries where fans can watch races live with F1 TV Pro. It’s also available in the Netherlands, home of F1 champion Max Verstappen, whose orange-clad fans follow his every turn. “It gave us, for the first time, a direct relationship with the fan,” says Ian Holmes, director of media rights at F1. “I had a concern as to how it would sit alongside third-party rights deals.”\\nOriginally, the interest primarily came from F1’s “more avid fans”, who wanted to watch more content in addition to the traditional broadcast. But F1’s thinking has evolved as new audiences have flocked to the sport. “It’s not just the avid fan,” says Holmes. “The younger fan is the most data-comfortable, interactive demographic out there.”\\nHolmes says F1 must be flexible in its approach. In some markets, such as Brazil and Mexico, F1 partners with telecoms companies and broadcasters, making them vital distributors of F1 TV, in addition to Apple and Android, where F1 sells the app subscription. In some cases, F1 and traditional broadcasters or networks also share revenues from distributing F1 TV Pro.\\n“We’re also looking at how to better distribute F1 TV rather than just go through the Apple Store or the Android equivalent,” says Holmes. “You start looking at direct billing relationships. Sometimes it’s more difficult — it’s probably the most frustrating thing in business if someone wants to give you money and you can’t take it from them.\\n“In some cases, it didn’t make business sense to force it into a market if it was going to cannibalise or overly cannibalise a third party licensing deal”.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nAccounts for Formula One Digital Media, the entity that houses F1 TV, reveal that the service made more than $47mn in revenues in 2021. That was an increase of nearly 150 per cent on the $19mn figure in 2020, mostly driven by subscriptions to the Pro product.\\nIn 2021, F1’s total media rights revenue totalled $860mn. Last year, that increased to $936mn — just over 40 per cent of the sport’s more than $2.6bn revenue total. It stood at roughly $670mn in 2020, when the sport’s season was postponed due to the pandemic.\\nFormula One Digital Media is yet to publish its accounts for 2022. However, Liberty Media said in its annual report for 2022 that F1 TV was one of the reasons for increased media rights revenues that year. F1 TV Pro’s strongest markets include the US, Mexico, Netherlands, Scandinavia and the Nordics, Holmes says, sitting alongside deals with traditional broadcasters.\\nAnalysts see further growth. In March, a research note by JPMorgan’s David Karnovsky said F1 TV “was a bigger driver of [media rights] revenue growth in 2022 than we initially appreciated, and remains a point of potential upside to our estimates for 2023”.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nHowever, traditional broadcast deals are also driving media rights revenues up. Karnovsky forecast that new contracts with the likes of ESPN in the US and Foxtel in Australia would help increase media rights revenues this year by 13 per cent.\\nMike Kerr, managing director for Asia Pacific at beIN Sports, says he is not worried about the rise of F1 TV Pro because traditional broadcasters can aggregate a variety of sports and bundle them with entertainment and news channels.\\nF1 TV Pro is not available in beIN Sport’s markets — which include Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand — as beIN has an exclusive deal to show races live on its ‘over-the-top’ streaming service, so fans can expect to “watch all of our content at any time, in any place on any screen”.\\n“I don’t think there is any sport that is big enough to go direct to the size of audience that we can,”, and we can only address the audience because we’ve got different sport on our own channels,” says Kerr. “The first three races of this year have been the most watched content on our networks except for the Liverpool-Real Madrid Champions League final in 2021”.\\nRecommended\\nThe UK, Italy and Germany are also among the countries where F1 TV Pro is not available, as Sky pays for exclusive rights to screen live sessions and racing. The broadcaster has a dedicated F1 channel and is a key partner to F1.\\nBut, ahead of this season, the F1 TV product has launched in India — giving F1 a presence in a market where it has not signed a traditional broadcast deal because, as Holmes explains, “the offers that were made, we didn’t think represented a fair valuation\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009people spent all their money on cricket”.\\nNext in line might be the Middle East, where the sport is negotiating with broadcasters, says Holmes.\\nF1 has been constantly trying to improve its media technology, as well. It’s no longer confined to smartphones — users can now “cast” the stream to their television screens. The next step could be to allow fans to engage onscreen with friends watching at the same time online, says Holmes. F1 is also “working hard” to make the Pro service available at circuits without a 20-30 second time delay. “It’s a continual evolution,” he says.', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/0c762af6-81c4-4c86-9258-33fea8d474dc', 'title': 'How F1 found a secret fuel to accelerate media rights growth', 'publication_time': '2023-05-27T04:00:40.809Z'}, uuid=UUID('b387b910-604a-49fe-99d1-91f6291072a5'), db_id=''),\n",

Today, a rift at the heart of the telecoms sector risks reversing decades of progress and plunging digital allies into a new phase of conflict.\\nEurope’s telecom companies want US corporations such as Alphabet, Netflix, Amazon and Meta to pay for the increasing video traffic they generate. These US giants originate data accounting for around 50 per cent of network loads. Europe’s telcos complain they bear massive additional costs without receiving any fees or extra revenues.\\nFor their part, the US corporations argue that such cross-industry subsidies are a form of protectionism. Indeed, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon already pay for their distribution platforms and related costs for content rights and production. They see these requests as a form of expropriation of their profits, which are much larger than those of the EU telcos.\\nAs a result, member states, industry associations and European MPs stand divided on the issue, while the EU Commission has launched a consultation on the future of the telecoms industry. The discussion over such profound and complex questions will fuel aggressive lobbying from all sides and possibly end up in litigation. Europe instead needs a balanced approach which addresses the legitimate funding requirements of the telecoms companies without unfairly punishing content providers.\\nThere is a strong social argument for ensuring that telcos earn a decent return on capital. At the moment its stands at a meagre 4 per cent, according to a recent analysis of established operators by JPMorgan, which is too low. A higher return would ensure there is adequate investment in ultra-wide and low-latency broadband (fibre and 5G) that would benefit both the welfare of citizens and the companies’ competitiveness. Industrial, agricultural, health, educational and mobility applications need fast, secure and low-latency networks. At the same time, it is clearly in the interest of European citizens that platforms distributing quality content can operate and thrive in Europe. It is right that, rather than feeling squeezed, US corporations contribute a fair proportion of the costs associated with distributing their videos.\\nA sensible compromise would be to only seek contributions from the largest operators — for example those loading above 5 or 7.5 per cent of a single network. These payments could be negotiated bilaterally between platforms and telecom companies, since investment requirements and networks are different. Antitrust authorities and regulators would only need to intervene — granting powers to access information and imposing a mandatory contribution based on\\xa0the existing “abuse of economic dependence” legislation — if no agreement could be reached.\\nThis approach would protect net neutrality and encourage genuine negotiations, reducing the risk of regulatory decisions which take time and often have unintended consequences. A market solution with safeguards is surely better than straight regulation or, worse, inaction.\\nHowever, these changes will not solve the networks’ problems with profitability and investment on their own. The EU should allow more in-market consolidation in the telecoms industry, reduce the support governments give to low-investment operators, and stop facilitating the assignment of frequencies to new entrants: all policies which distort fairness for established networks\\xa0and squeeze them\\xa0for spectrum renewals.\\nIn short, the EU should reward those who are willing to invest. Much as with the transatlantic telegraph cables, all sides stand to gain from a robust, innovative and future-proof European telecoms infrastructure.\\n', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/ffc2d92b-ee89-4699-9a10-dc6a477f52a6', 'title': 'Battles over the cost of video traffic are creating a rift across the Atlantic', 'publication_time': '2023-04-30T12:00:19.499Z'}, uuid=UUID('788edae3-4bd9-41ac-b938-ec9c0b78dccf'), db_id=''),\n",

Adding a cheaper $6.99 per month advertising subscription tier and stepping up efforts to crack down on password sharing should be doing the trick.\\nBut these are not the sort of moves that endear a company to its customers or drive the zeitgeist and win Oscars. Nor is shutting a mail-order DVD business whose revenue halved last year.\\nNetflix is always first to start the tech earnings season , often setting the tone for consumer-facing companies. This time last year, it announced its first subscriber drop in a decade, triggering a sharp fall in the share price.

It helps that rivals such as Disney have been forced to accept that expensive streaming content requires higher subscription prices. HBO Max just provided an own goal by naming its streaming service Max, dropping the only part of its name that is associated with popular shows.\\nStill, revenue up less than 4 per cent for the first three months of the year does not befit a growth stock, even if it is better than the sub 2 per cent growth reported at the end of last year.

It recorded growth in the number of paying subscribers and revenues from its streaming business, but a 6.5 per cent fall in operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation — a fall driven partly by declining advertising revenues.', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a14692e9-6a9a-4517-ba15-fcc82065013a', 'title': 'Bertelsmann chief puts goal of national TV mergers on ice', 'publication_time': '2023-03-30T13:21:22.573Z'}, uuid=UUID('aee56dc2-cd13-4df6-8371-5104f2a26c33'), db_id=''),\n",

Apple signed a 10-year deal with Major League Soccer. Now YouTube has agreed to pay about $2bn per year for exclusive rights to certain National Football League Sunday afternoon games.\\nPerhaps Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai is an American football fan? This is an expensive way for YouTube’s parent company to buy an audience. YouTubeTV costs $64.99 per month. If it charges a $25 add-on for NFL games, it will need 1.85mn subscribers to break even. That means increasing its subscriber base by around a third. It will hope to pick up subscribers from former NFL Sunday Ticket rights holder DirecTV.\\nThere is a reason Apple and Amazon do not separate out profits and losses from their own streaming services. Alphabet reports only YouTube’s advertising revenue (which is down on last year). Subscriptions for YouTube Premium and YouTube TV are included in “other” — a huge category that also includes in-app purchases and sales of Fitbits.\\nAlphabet says the division’s growth is led by YouTube. Given the increase was less than 2 per cent in the nine months ending September 30, this is not particularly impressive.\\nLook at results published by rivals and the brutal impact of competition is clear. Disney’s “direct to consumer” media and entertainment unit — aka streaming — reported an operating loss of $4bn on revenue of just under $20bn in the 12 months to October 2. Charging low monthly rates while buying pricey programmes is expensive.\\nAlphabet has the funds to compete. The NFL deal is equal to about 3 per cent of free cash flow last year. Using sport to lock in long-term subscribers may mitigate the slump in US streaming audiences that Netflix reports. YouTube has a seven-year contract with the NFL.\\nBut sports broadcasting is not an automatic money-spinner. See BT’s exit from the game.

Excluding production shutdowns during the coronavirus pandemic, the rate of expansion is the lowest in more than a decade where total worldwide spending jumped from $128bn to $243bn.\\nCommercial broadcasters such as RTL, Mediaset and ITV are facing some of the most severe pressure. Ampere predicts total original spending will fall by 3 per cent as the sector tries to cope with an advertising downturn, rising production costs and declining audiences for linear channels.\\nBut streaming services have also begun to enter more straitened times, as media groups rein in costs to manage slower than expected subscriber growth and ballooning losses from establishing the platforms.\\nTotal content spending for subscription streaming services, such as HBO Max, Disney Plus and Netflix , will continue to increase but at a rate of 8 per cent rather than the 25 per cent breakneck growth in 2022.\\n“Services will continue to focus on original content to compete in a crowded, cost-sensitive market, but we are already seeing a shift in content commissioning to incorporate a greater volume of cheaper unscripted formats,” said Hannah Walsh, research manager at Ampere.\\nRecommended\\nNetflix, which accounts for about 25 per cent of spending on original streaming shows, said it was holding spending steady at around $17bn a year, while trying to make its shows more “impactful”. “The key for me is not that you have to spend more and more money,” said Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s co-chief executive, last month. “It’s: can you get more impact per million dollar spend than anybody else?”\\nMeanwhile, big legacy media companies such as Disney , Paramount and Warner Bros Discovery are facing another year of heavy streaming losses, with Morgan Stanley estimating content costs per subscriber will be almost double that of Netflix while revenue per member will be lower.\\nExcluding Netflix, Morgan Stanley estimates streaming services suffered operating losses of around $10bn in 2022.

       "  (Document(text='\\nChristopher Grimes in Los Angeles\\nThe creative talent behind shows on Netflix’s new ad-supported service should earn more money if their series are popular with viewers, the chief of one of Hollywood’s top talent agencies has argued, a move that would represent a major shift in the streaming pioneer’s model.\\nIn November, Netflix introduced a new subscription service in which viewers have access to a more limited selection of titles for a lower price in exchange for watching ads.\\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, Jeremy Zimmer, head of the United Talent Agency, said this new strategy “changes the game” in terms of how the streamer should compensate creative talent.\\n“A show that does really well will get more advertisers and more revenue will flow to Netflix,” he added. “Therefore, our clients who created that show should be compensated for that additional revenue.”\\nNetflix, which launched its ad-supported service to offset slowing subscriber growth , has long resisted profit-sharing arrangements. Instead of offering traditional “back end” payments that allow talent to earn more from\\xa0a successful show, Netflix buys out all rights upfront.\\nBut Zimmer says Netflix’s launch of an ad-supported service has altered that formula.\\n“They’ve changed all the rules [by saying] it’s no longer an ad-free environment,” he said. “There’s a different revenue stream coming in that they had said wasn’t going to be there.”\\nNetflix is likely to resist attempts by UTA or its rivals, including Creative Artists Agency and WME, to seek new sources of revenue tied to performance. However, talent agencies are trying to use the streamers’ advertising push — Disney Plus also launched an ad\\xa0tier this month — as an opportunity to persuade them that aligning artists’ financial interests with the performance of programmes is good for both parties.\\nThe nature of the advertising business means that there will be more transparency on how shows perform than Netflix has allowed in the past. With the launch of the ad service, Netflix will now allow detailed data to be collected by Nielsen ratings — allowing talent to access more information about how well their programmes perform on the platform. In theory, this could give artists leverage to bargain for more money when they produce a hit.\\nHowever, analysts say they do not expect meaningful profits from Netflix’s advertising business any time soon. “They’re off to a slow start” with the advertising service, said Tim Nollen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital. “It looks like 2025 before we see any real benefit from it.”\\nNetflix is missing its advertising viewership guarantees by as much as 20 per cent, according to a report this month in Digiday, which suggested the streaming service was returning cash to advertisers as a result.\\nNollen noted that the ad service was still new, but he said he was surprised by a lack of promotion of the advertising tier. “Netflix is in a bit of a quandary,” he added. “They don’t want to dilute themselves” by incentivising full-price subscribers to switch to the lower-cost advertising tier.\\nZimmer said there had not been serious discussions with Netflix about profit-sharing arrangements because it is “all relatively new”. But he said when clients launch new programmes on Netflix, “they will want to build in opportunities to get compensated for shows that are successful and are deemed successful by advertisers and audiences”.\\nRecommended\\nThe streaming industry itself is facing serious headwinds , including slower subscription growth and investor impatience with the billions of dollars that the traditional Hollywood groups have lost trying to build up their services. A potential strike by the Writers Guild of America when its contract ends in May could also deal a blow to studios.\\nMorgan Stanley analysts wrote this month that if the streaming services launched by traditional studios were unable to deliver “meaningful” profits in the next two years, some would need to “give up and/or consolidate”.\\nSome could choose to emulate Sony’s “arms dealer” strategy of selling content to streamers or even traditional TV networks, the analysts added.\\nZimmer said Netflix and other streamers would do well to sell their shows to rivals.\\n“All the streamers are now realising, ‘Wow, we could use additional revenue’,” he added. “Maybe those shows don’t need to just sit on our servers alone.”\\nSyndicating their content to broadcasters would allow the streamers to\\xa0 generate extra revenue — and open another profit opportunity to the creative talent, Zimmer said. “The revenue they get from that would be a way to share proceeds from the creators.”\\n', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/c31e104d-0154-4508-b4c2-5c0d643bd9ae', 'title': 'Hollywood talent agencies seek new deals tied to Netflix ads', 'publication_time': '2023-01-02T05:00:25.587Z'}, uuid=UUID('9d4186ad-2480-44f5-8187-4428b62f5286'), db_id=''),\n",

Her bet is that ITVX, the new player launched in full this week, will “supercharge” the UK broadcaster’s online offering.\\nFor McCall, almost five years into the job, the stakes are high. ITV has come to epitomise the decline of traditional broadcasters, reflected in a more than 50 per cent fall in the company’s market value under her tenure and its ejection this year from the FTSE 100 index.\\nAs digital viewing options have proliferated — Paramount+ and Nordic streamer Viaplay are among the recent entrants to an increasingly crowded market — ITV has had to battle to remain relevant.\\nThe ITV Hub is seen as dated, clunky to use and overloaded with intrusive adverts — the unhappy outcome of years of under-investment and a historic prioritisation of dividend payouts, according to one person who knows the company well.\\nAfter working on its replacement for about 18 months, and with an initial budget of about £225mn for content and technology, insiders are confident they finally have a worthy competitor.\\n“We are creating a destination” for viewers rather than just a catch-up player, said Rufus Radcliffe, managing director of streaming.\\nAs well as a faster and sharper interface, ITVX will feature 15,000 hours of content — about 10 times more than its predecessor.\\nSeveral programmes will be shown on the service months before they are broadcast on TV: the first exclusives, including A Spy Among Friends , a drama about the cold war double agent Kim Philby, and Plebs: Soldiers of Rome , a feature-length comedy with Tom Rosenthal, arrived this week.\\nWithout Sin , a thriller featuring Vicky McClure, is among the other shows that Kevin Lygo, ITV’s director of television, has specially commissioned.\\nUntil now, ITV has been “reticent” to premier shows online because “they make so much more money on terrestrial” TV, said Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis. But the company’s hand has been forced because “linear viewing is dropping so quickly”.\\nHe questioned whether the digital-first programming strategy would ultimately be successful.\\nIn part to minimise the risk of technical problems with the ITVX launch, executives opted for a phased switch, in which users of the Hub were upgraded over several weeks.\\nThose precautions meant the new platform was not fully rolled out for the group stages of the World Cup, although it will be in time for England’s quarter-final showdown with France on Saturday night.\\nThe broadcaster is expecting its largest audience for a single event for many years, including about 2mn-3mn on ITVX.\\nStill, some in the City worry that the plans for the platform are “too little, too late”, said Sarah Simon, analyst at Berenberg.\\nThe launch comes as a deteriorating UK economy puts ITV’s linear channels under further pressure, while competition for viewer attention has only intensified. Netflix recently rolled out an ad-supported version of its player in the UK and Disney is also planning to do so after a launch in the US this week.\\nUsage data from Kantar underline the challenge: only about one-fifth of British households watch the Hub more than two days per week, compared with two-fifths for the iPlayer. Younger viewers have been particularly elusive.\\nIndustry executives warned that a substantial improvement in the user experience over the Hub was a minimum requirement.\\nSome users of ITVX have already complained of technical difficulties, although executives insisted the rollout had gone smoothly and that such problems were typically caused by individual devices or connections.\\nThousands of people had taken part in trials, Radcliffe said. “We wouldn’t be launching it if we weren’t really confident\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009We’ve left no stone unturned here.”\\nThe World Cup is an important showcase for other content available on ITVX, whose collection of more than 300 films includes the Back to the Future trilogy and critically acclaimed classics such as Reservoir Dogs , There Will Be Blood and City of God .\\n“People are coming to watch the football and seeing other stuff,” Radcliffe said, adding that some viewers may be surprised by the breadth of available programming, which includes an anime section. ITVX also features regular news bulletins and an expanded line-up for children.\\nMore shows will be available next year. ITV is in talks with rival providers to offer other paid-for video content through the new platform, even if its ambitions stop short of being a fully fledged aggregator of online content.\\n“I don’t recognise that we’re late” with the launch, Radcliffe said. “In terms of viewing behaviour, and where it’s going, this feels like the right time to take this to the next stage.”\\nHe argued that free-to-view content would be an increasingly important advantage for ITV as the cost-of-living squeeze persisted, predicting households would undertake a “big rationalising” of their subscriptions in the new year.\\nITV is simultaneously pushing to increase annual revenues from subscriptions, laying down a target to double subscriber numbers to 2.5m by 2026 with an ad-free variant of ITVX offered for £5.99 per month.\\nBut Radcliffe made clear the free version was the company’s “priority”, estimating that 90 per cent of viewers would be in this tier. He maintained that having so much content available without charge was a “very compelling proposition” for consumers.\\nFor ITV itself, however, the challenges go beyond the success or failure of the streaming platform.\\nMarketers have long used the broad appeal of ITV programming, such as Coronation Street, to reach a mass audience, and low and middle income households in particular.\\nBut tightened budgets during the inflationary squeeze have put the broadcaster on course for a fall in ad revenues this year.\\n“Even if ITVX works, I don’t see how ITV’s broadcasting business really grows,” said Berenberg’s Simon. “Why is ITV not going to continue to lose share of video advertising?

That goes not just for consumers but also for the companies that want to sell to them. The upshot is that more advertising money is moving into online videos — and TV, film and entertainment incumbents are scrambling to get a piece of the action.\\nAccording to technology research firm Omdia, the Big Four tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Apple — will this year gobble up 68 per cent of the nearly $500bn in revenue that companies, excluding those in China, are expected to generate from online advertising.\\nOnline video marketing is the fastest-growing segment in the booming world of digital advertising, and Omdia estimates that more money will be spent on video-based campaigns than on those attached to text-based articles or search results by 2025.\\n“Historically, when you thought about the big [video-based] media companies, you thought about broadcasters,” says Marija Masalskis, senior analyst for TV, video and advertising at Omdia.\\n“But now they are small compared to companies like YouTube and Facebook [and] the most significant part of this story is how huge [the respective parent companies] Google and Meta have become in comparison with the big TV brands.”\\nThe four giants of the internet are known for their so-called walled gardens of data — their expansive yet enclosed ecosystems of often free-to-use services. These enable them to build unique profiles of users’ lifestyles and habits, which they can sell to advertisers.\\nTheir dominance in this space has only been strengthened by the recent pivot to more privacy-friendly policies from both regulators and corporate peers. Such moves include the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the rollback of cookies — data packets that enable advertisers and others to track users across websites — on browsers including Apple’s Safari and Google’s Chrome.\\nA striking illustration of advertisers’ former reliance on cookies comes from Facebook itself, which in July said it was still in the “early” stages of figuring out how to counteract Apple’s privacy changes, which since last year have cost Facebook more than $10bn in lost revenue.\\n“We are already in the midst of a cookie-less world now,” says Kelly Barrett, senior vice-president of product management at analytics company comScore, adding that she is advising clients to amass so-called first-party data without delay.\\n“So authentication, for example — ‘Hey, before we show you this content, mind if you tell us a little about who you are?’ — and when they come to the website a second time, you already know who they are,” Barrett explains.\\nCountries to watch 2022-2026\\nIndia Omdia expects that advertising revenue linked to online searches and video will nearly double between 2022 and 2026.\\nUS Convergence of traditional TV and online video advertising is a key trend in what is still the world’s largest advertising market.\\nChina The country has the world’s fastest-growing online advertising market, despite a slowdown last year caused by tighter regulation.\\nArgentina With what is predicted to be the fastest-growing advertising market in Latin America, Argentina is attracting interest from growth-hungry US companies.\\nSource: FT-Omdia Digital Economies Index\\nIn the US, the world’s largest advertising market, traditional media companies are now investing heavily in building closer relationships with their customers, Barrett says — a transition that smaller players in particular need to manage well.\\nMasalskis warns that “online and TV companies are now competing for the same ad dollars”, with Facebook now making more money from video-based advertising than any broadcaster does — evidence of the value of first-party data when it comes to marketing.\\nShe notes, however, that Facebook and YouTube are facing stiff competition from fast-growing video platform TikTok . Last month Facebook parent Meta reported a third-quarter fall in revenue , while YouTube announced a decline in advertising revenue. Omdia predicts that, by 2027, TikTok’s advertising revenue will exceed that of Meta and YouTube combined.\\n“[And] it’s not like the broadcasters are sitting on their hands and doing nothing,” Masalskis adds. Broadcasters such as Disney, NBC and the UK’s ITV have scrambled to launch both streaming sites and ad-buying platforms that make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses to reach their viewers.\\nPlanet V, ITV’s advertising hub launched in 2020, tries to compete with Google and Facebook by targeting the smaller businesses that make up a big chunk of new advertisers, and which have traditionally been drawn to the large tech platforms.\\n“This means smaller businesses can now buy ads easily on ITV, without having to meet with a sales representative,” says Matthew Bailey, an analyst at Omdia.\\nRecommended\\nBut the key to making it in online advertising is still to build a large, enclosed ecosystem. Disney, for example, amasses data about its customers as they move between its streaming services, resorts and cruises. “They have a lot of information about their users, so they are in a strong position,” Masalskis says.\\nBill Stratton, head of media entertainment and advertising at adtech firm Snowflake, says the traditional broadcasters still have leverage — in the form of good old creativity.\\n“Say HBO and Disney, they have Emmys, Academy Awards and strong [intellectual property] — that’s very attractive to customers and advertisers,” he says.\\nSnowflake, which was founded a decade ago and counts Disney and NBCUniversal among its clients, has in recent years started operating so-called data clean rooms, a type of adtech platform that has boomed since the phaseout of cookies began. They allow a company to upload its first-party data and have it matched with data from other sources, enabling better consumer targeting in a way the industry deems privacy-compliant.\\nAccording to Stratton, the new system is better for advertisers. “The problem with cookies was, you were always losing the signal, because the user would clear their cache,” he says. “First-party data is more permanent.”', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1edc5629-482e-4050-a821-e3322d17b266', 'title': 'Advertisers binge on online video', 'publication_time': '2022-11-23T05:00:08.104Z'}, uuid=UUID('a4f5310d-2e71-4140-88df-2ecf932b5e2e'), db_id=''),\n",

Among them is Sony, which does not have a streaming service but has taken an “arms dealer” strategy of selling film and TV rights to the highest bidder.\\n“If you’re Sony, they’re going to take a pound of flesh out,” said an executive at an investment group that acquires media copyright royalties. “It’s like going to a hotel. This [room] has a view of the ocean as opposed to a view of the mountains. You’re going to have to pay more money.”\\nNetflix said the new ad-supported service, which will cost $6.99 a month, is not “a revenue sharing model” at the moment, but the industry expects it will shift that position soon.\\nRecommended\\nFor the studios and talent, the negotiations over the advertising-based streaming service represent a larger opportunity than just a cut of the ad revenue. They also hope to regain some of the performance-based pay, or “back end”, that they have lost in the streaming era.\\nUnder the current system, talent behind Netflix hits such as Squid Game did not share the spoils of their success. “It’s not like Netflix is paying me a bonus. Netflix paid me according to the original contract”, Hwang Dong-hyuk, the creator of the show, said last year .\\nWith its subscription-based model, Netflix has been able to provide far fewer data about how its shows perform than traditional TV networks do. But the company will begin working next year with Nielsen, the ratings service, to gather the detailed data that advertisers demand.\\nA big question is whether this will “lead to a performance-based back end for the creative talent”, said Stephen Saltzman, head of the international entertainment group at law firm Fieldfisher. “I believe that it will put more pressure on Netflix to come up with performance-based metrics and compensation for the creative community.”', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/f21e934d-acbe-4c4b-ac15-a3a6460abdd2', 'title': 'Hollywood seeks a cut as Netflix debuts ad-supported streaming', 'publication_time': '2022-11-02T05:01:01.600Z'}, uuid=UUID('3fa09318-4b2d-433b-804c-0e7e2348a790'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nGreg Peters\\nThe writer is chief operating officer of Netflix\\nOld arguments die hard. A decade ago, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic were consumed by a debate about who should foot the bill for the infrastructure that powers the internet. On one side, telecoms companies argued that content providers were “freeriding” on their infrastructure and should pay more. On the other, a coalition led by civil society and consumer groups was lobbying for an open and interoperable web. Ultimately, plans for internet tolls were shelved and “net neutrality” won the day.\\nTen years later and we’re having the same conversation again in Europe, even though recent history has shown that the interests of telcos and content companies are in fact aligned. Last month, the chief executives of 16 European telcos said that companies like Netflix should pay extra on account of the “sizeable costs they currently impose on European networks”. But internet usage is not driven by companies — the traffic is generated by consumers, who pay for higher priced broadband packages precisely because they want fast, high-quality access to great film, TV, games and more. Far from being a cost telcos must bear, entertainment generates the demand which internet service providers (ISPs) need in order to grow, which is why they bundle services like Netflix directly into the consumer packages they offer.\\nISPs benefit directly from Netflix’s $15bn programming budget. We’ve invested more than €4bn in local productions across Europe over the past five years, generating tens of thousands of jobs in the creative economy. We will also contribute more than €1.5bn in European cultural levies and investment obligations over the next three years. For all the concerns about freeriding, these are in fact mutually beneficial relationships from which infrastructure providers and entertainment companies gain economically — and in business terms that seems the very definition of “fairness”.\\nOur partnership with ISPs extends beyond Netflix’s consumer services to the underlying networks at the heart of this debate. We’ve invested more than $1bn in our content delivery network called Open Connect, which we offer free to ISPs. We have 18,000 servers containing our content in 6,000 locations (and growing) across 175 countries. So when consumers press play, the film or TV show is streamed from around the corner — reducing traffic and costs for operators around the world, while also ensuring the highest quality, no-lag experience for our members.\\nLast decade’s dire predictions that the growth in usage was unsustainable unless content providers paid more have proven to be unfounded: internet traffic grew tenfold yet operators’ capital spending remained stable. It’s telling that European telcos’ energy consumption is also forecast to be flat over the next 10 years, despite growing traffic. As research by Analysys Mason (and funded by Netflix) concluded: the “growing demand from end users can be handled sustainably without increasing network costs over time”. This was confirmed by Europe’s telecoms regulators who stated on October 7 that the costs of internet network infrastructure were “not very traffic-sensitive”.\\nA year ago, Squid Game premiered on Netflix and quickly became a global sensation. With 1.6bn hours viewed in its first month, this Korean drama unexpectedly became our biggest TV show ever. We’ve had huge successes with Lupin from France and Casa de Papel from Spain. As consumers and broadcasters shift from linear streaming to on-demand, we want a system that encourages more investment in content and supports more hits like these, whether they’re on Netflix or France Television, Rai, Telecinco, ARD, the BBC or Viaplay.\\nThe internet tolls proposed by telcos today are unconnected to their actual infrastructure deployment costs and would divert significant resources from European content — weakening entertainment companies, the attractiveness of higher-priced broadband packages and undermining Europe’s creative community.\\nTaxing entertainment and media companies to subsidise telcos was a bad idea in 2012, and the same is true today. We need to move on from the debates of yesteryear and recognise that when we work together, and both invest in our respective strengths, we all thrive.', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/22d376ec-cb4a-455d-882a-ff15edc1205f', 'title': 'Hitting content providers with internet tolls would damage the web ecosystem', 'publication_time': '2022-10-20T13:33:30.777Z'}, uuid=UUID('d44512a7-836d-45ee-a0ae-124bac4b15f6'), db_id=''),\n",

Vast content commitments, losses and heavy debt have all been tolerated so long as this number rises. When it fell, so did the share price. Netflix’s solution is to stop reporting guidance for the number.\\nThere is reason to think this will work. Apple stopped reporting iPhone unit sales in 2019 after growth flattened. Instead, it pushed investors to look at revenue — where higher prices made up for lower unit sales. The nudge was successful.\\nBut Netflix is banking on high revenue growth that is not certain. In November, it will launch an ad-supported subscription tier. At $6.99 per month it is less than half the price of the ad-free rate and cheaper than rival services. The hope is that this will erase the damage done by two consecutive quarters of subscription declines earlier this year. But Netflix risks cannibalising its own users and lowering average revenue per user in the process.\\nNetflix claims its rivals are in worse shape: collectively losing $10bn a year. But its high-handed dismissal of the competition has not convinced investors. In the third quarter, subscriptions rose by 2.4mn . A return to growth lifted the share price 13 per cent in after-hours trading — though it remains down on the year and is still underperforming the wider S&P 500.\\nNetflix carved out a new sector in streaming services, upending cable television. For a comparatively small monthly fee, users get access to high-quality shows, unburdened by adverts and TV schedules. Over time it has gathered 223mn subscribers, become a global brand and won Oscars. But it has also attracted a host of imitators that have chipped away at growth.\\nSome of the panic around subscriptions is unfair. Subscriber losses followed a record 37mn additions in 2020. Churn makes sense. Despite big content creation plans, free cash flow is positive.\\nBut Netflix lacks the alternative revenue stream that a rival such as Disney can lean on. Adding advertising revenue is welcome, though Netflix is entering just as Disney makes the same move and the digital advertising market is in a downturn. Still, if Netflix could add $2bn in advertising revenue (half the sum Morgan Stanley expects Disney and Netflix to make between them) plus another $2bn from subscribers on the new ad-supported tier (equal to about 10 per cent of ad-free subscribers) it would lift 2024 revenues above $41.5bn and return growth to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels.\\nThese are optimistic estimates. The more gloomy forecast is that Netflix encourages existing subscribers to move to the lower tier and fails to win many new joiners.

Comcast, the US media conglomerate, said last month it would consider spinning off its cable television networks, a fading if profitable business that will eventually disappear in a digital streaming era. With Trump’s election expected to unleash dealmakers’ animal spirits, expect a wave of media M&A as the poor economics of the business becomes a catalysing event.\\nComcast itself is a textbook example of the type of Frankenstein’s monster, created over multiple eras, that no longer makes sense in media. Two-thirds of its $120bn in annual revenue comes from “dumb pipes” — broadband and mobile phone service that collectively have more than 30mn customers. Wall Street has, however, turned sour on that business as subscriber additions have turned negative and the capital costs remain high.\\nThe Philadelphia-based company also has broadcaster NBCUniversal, which produces and distributes film and TV, along with several pay-TV networks such as CNBC and Bravo. The networks are bleeding subscribers as cable and satellite television become less popular.\\nThe 80 per cent fall in the share price of AMC, a pure-play listed cable business, in the past five years suggests investors don’t love those trends. But spinning off its cable networks would rid Comcast of an albatross.\\nComcast’s upstart streaming offering, Peacock, is a more intriguing prospect. Its subscribers soared this year to 36mn, helped by NBC’s coverage of the Olympics. But its losses remain massive, at nearly $1bn so far this year. Comcast management says it is open to “partnerships” for Peacock — a nod to the brutal economics of internet-first video.\\nWith a hands-off Trump administration, Peacock could seek to merge with a rival such as Paramount Plus or Warner Bros Discovery’s Max — something the Biden regime might have frowned on. Warner boss David Zaslav said on Thursday that the White House changeover offered an opportunity to consolidate that would “provide a real positive and accelerated impact on this industry that’s needed”.\\nComcast, like rival Walt Disney, has at least had a theme parks division to prop it up while figuring out how to deliver content profitably. Comcast shares, for example, are flat this year. Questions like how to share content across a split-up empire are not easy to resolve. With a dealmaking window suddenly opening, though, next year is a good time to try.\\nsujeet.indap@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/5cf6e332-7bf6-4de0-a2d4-fda9f8482bfd', 'title': 'The starting gun has sounded on US media consolidation', 'publication_time': '2024-11-07T17:04:16.327Z'}, uuid=UUID('bf68fbd4-789b-40b4-bfc0-aa501c7a794c'), db_id=''),\n",

But the technology has improved to the point where former sticking points, such as picture quality and time lag, are now acceptable to many fans. And while expensive, live sports are a powerful way of targeting multiple demographic segments and driving new subscriptions. Ad revenues are also becoming an increasingly important component of streamers' income.

For example, between 2019 and 2024, the value of the US sports rights market grew by 54 per cent, compared to an overall TV industry revenue growth of just 15 per cent. While streamers' spending on sports rights has soared recently, that explosive growth may ease off in the coming years, not least because many of the major sports rights deals still have years to run before renewal.

But with its $7.6bn deal to acquire full control of DirecTV from AT&T, private equity group TPG is betting the industry can survive for long enough to fund a budget streaming option to challenge the new powerhouses of the entertainment business — Disney, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple.\\nFollowing Monday’s deal, TPG plans to merge DirecTV with Dish, the industry’s second-largest player, and fund a challenger TV option for cost-conscious Americans who want highly tailored bundles of sports, news and scripted entertainment.\\nThe combination of the two groups will put TPG in control of a pay-TV business with 18mn subscribers that is on track to generate more than $6bn in combined annual free cash flow this year. The buyout group believed those profits were sufficient to fund a competitive streaming TV service , said two people briefed on its thinking, and were enough for the private equity group to engineer a financial return while stewarding the decline of satellite TV.\\nTwo decades ago, satellite TV beamed into the homes of nearly a third of paying TV users in the US before millions cut their service in recent years.\\nTPG’s bet comes at a time of mass change and strife within the media industry as consumers cancel cable and fibre service offerings for cheaper internet packages offered by Alphabet, Netflix and Apple, leaving many large media and telecommunications saddled with writedowns and even financial distress. The pressures have led to recent carriage disputes between media companies such as Disney and telecommunications providers including DirecTV and Charter Communications.\\nThe cash TPG plans to pour into DirecTV and Dish underscores the pain absorbed by the industry over the past decade. In sum, it has struck deals to take control of satellite TV operations once worth about $80bn on public stock markets in 2015 for less than $4bn in its own investors’ cash, according to Financial Times’ calculations and people familiar with the matter.\\nTPG first invested in DirecTV in 2021 when it paid $1.6bn to buy a 30 per cent stake in the business from AT&T, which five years earlier had paid $67bn to acquire the satellite TV operator. AT&T used the buyout group’s investment to begin extricating itself from what MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett called on Monday “one of the worst transactions in American history”.\\nAs part of the deal, AT&T carved out DirecTV as a new company with a $16.3bn enterprise valuation — a quarter of what it paid.\\nTPG on Monday struck a deal to acquire the remaining 70 per cent of DirecTV from AT&T. The buyout group will use $2bn of equity to fund the purchase and it will pay the remainder through a mixture of new debt, dividends paid to AT&T until the deal closes — expected in late 2025 — and an earnout payment in 2029, the people said.\\nThe Dish assets TPG is acquiring will come at an even lower cost. The buyout group will merge DirecTV with the ailing Dish Network, owned by Charlie Ergen’s EchoStar, for a nominal $1 in cash and the assumption of $11.7bn in debt that had pressured the company.\\nThe tie-up comes with the scale TPG believes can be used to prop up both companies’ fledgling internet-first options, DirecTV Stream and Dish TV. Their so-called “skinny bundles” of targeted media offerings carry a lower cost than broader offerings such as YouTube TV, something that should give the services a “fighting chance” against tech giants including Alphabet, said one person.\\nBut that bet is secondary to TPG’s belief that DirecTV’s existing satellite TV operations are profitable enough to generate a return, even as they bleed subscribers.\\nThe bet will be tested by industry trends moving decidedly against DirecTV. Streaming companies Netflix and Hulu, in addition to direct offerings from media companies Disney and Paramount, have made content middlemen increasingly obsolete. These offerings have captured hundreds of millions of new customers in recent years. Amazon’s Prime Video service, for instance, has 115mn subscribers, about 11 times DirecTV’s subscriber base.\\n“The merger of DirecTV and Dish Network won’t change the subscriber trajectory,” Moffett, the analyst said, though it will reduce expenses.\\nTPG’s bet has begun to pay off.

For its base $ 80-a-month plan, customers can stream hundreds of channels, yet most are interested in the handful of brand-name networks that show sports matches.\\nBut on Friday, this little-known company pulled off an epic upset .\\nA New York federal district court issued an injunction keeping three industry heavyweights — Disney’s ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros Discovery — from launching a specialist sports-only streamer , only weeks before its intended debut. Fubo had argued in a lawsuit that the joint venture, called Venu, was anti-competitive and the judge has temporarily agreed.\\nFor Fubo, there is little time to celebrate. Its annual revenue is under $2bn, its market capitalisation is down to $500mn and it is spending precious cash to buy back convertible bonds that come due in less than two years.\\nDisney, Fox and WBD had planned for Venu to cost just $43 a month at the outset. No doubt Fubo would love to slash its price in half to keep up. But the likes of Disney force Fubo to buy not just ESPN — whose wholesale cost to distributors can be as much as $9 a month — but other unpopular networks that require subsidy.\\nFubo sued the trio under the theory that they created Venu to carry sports channels only, an “unbundled” arrangement not offered to Fubo. The judge agreed that this disparate treatment was enough to issue an injunction before a full trial.\\nDisney, Fox and WBD hate unbundling — the pay-TV package deal had underpinned their huge profits for decades. But cable and satellite “cord cutting” is now inexorable. Narrowly tailored products such as Venu — however suboptimal — are then their only hope to survive in a world where customers demand à la carte entertainment options.\\nFubo went public in 2020. Like classic disrupters, it is unburdened by legacy business models. But while innovative, its business is yet to prove sustainable as it also lacks the strong cash flows that still emanate from old-school media.\\nDisney, Fox and WBD may eventually be forced by the courts to sell ESPN and their other sports networks as standalone products to Fubo and others. But it is not obvious that the maths will work out for any of them.\\nsujeet.indap@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/3a53fcfb-ce33-4f53-b9ba-b5b3173824e7', 'title': 'Can a streaming underdog succeed against ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros?', 'publication_time': '2024-08-19T11:00:32.989Z'}, uuid=UUID('94959eab-6b23-47c6-ae0c-803de31de4d2'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text=\"\\nDaniel Thomas and Camilla Hodgson in London\\nAmazon’s Prime Video is undercutting rival Netflix on advertising pricing, as it battles for marketers’ attention in an increasingly crowded field of ad-funded streaming services.\\nAmazon introduced advertising to its Prime Video platform five months ago and is going through its first “up front” — when television companies present their plans to advertisers to attract money over the next year.\\nThe Seattle-based company has joined a highly competitive market for ad-supported streaming services . Most rival platforms — including Netflix, Max, Paramount+ and Disney+ — have brought in an ad-supported tier at a lower price than subscriptions that carry no ads.\\nAnalysts expect Apple to bring ads to its streaming TV+ service soon too. More conventional TV companies are also offering ad-supported streaming services, while Fox’s Tubi only offers shows backed by ads.\\nThe “bundles” that advertisers buy — in different formats and with various services attached — can make direct comparisons difficult. But multiple executives at rival services, as well as advertising bosses, said Amazon was pricing its spots more cheaply than Netflix, although at a higher rate than others such as Disney.\\nThe arrival of Amazon had already forced rivals to reduce their own pricing, according to advertising sources. One rival executive noted Amazon’s “vast supply of inventory”, adding: “There is downward pressure. They knew what they were doing in terms of flipping everybody over into the tier.”\\nAmazon and Netflix declined to comment.\\nAmazon’s arrival has particularly worried executives at rival streamers because of its existing strength in retail that analysts expect will fuel interest in its Prime ad slots.\\nThe ecommerce giant automatically converted all its more than 200mn total global subscribers to the ad tier — unless they actively chose to pay more for the premium ad-free service. That meant Amazon immediately had a huge audience with which to lure advertisers.\\nIt was a “pretty dramatic and contrarian move” and had resulted in a “sudden accumulation of an advertising audience, which is pretty powerful”, said Jonathan Carson, chief executive of industry data provider Antenna.\\nThe company has a vast trove of shopper data and the ability to direct viewers to its online stores.\\nOne US TV executive said competition had noticeably increased since Amazon’s entry, adding that Prime Video ads had “made a big impact”.\\nAmazon has rapidly grown its multibillion-dollar advertising business — driven by ads on its online stores — which generated $11.8bn in sales in the first quarter of 2024, up from $9.5bn in the year-ago period.\\nAnalysts at JPMorgan said in June that the division was Amazon’s “fastest-increasing revenue stream and one of its highest-margin businesses”.\\nThe arrival of Prime Video ads was likely to propel that growth, analysts expect. Citi estimated in January that Prime Video adverts could generate more than $5bn in “high-margin advertising revenue” as it builds up, albeit a figure still substantially below the $19bn Amazon invested in video and music content in 2023.\\nBaird analysts in May said they had seen “healthy demand from both traditional linear and streaming video advertisers” for the new Prime Video ad slots. This year was “the soft rollout of Prime streaming ads” with a “bigger step-up” expected in 2025, Baird said.\\nChief executive Andy Jassy has said he believes that Prime Video can be “a large and profitable business on its own”.\\nAdvertising executives said Amazon offered brands the chance to target specific audiences thanks to the data it has from its retail platform.\\nPrime Video adverts were “the perfect closed loop attribution that we’ve been waiting for on linear TV” because “Amazon knows who you are” and what a viewer has bought on the Amazon.com website, said Citi analyst Ron Josey. “It’s a very large opportunity for them.”\\nIn May, Amazon announced “shoppable” ad formats for Prime Video to allow viewers to add products to their Amazon shopping cart during ad breaks using their smart TV remotes.\\nOne ad executive said that every brand was interested in “higher efficiency and more targeting” — both of which were being offered by Amazon.\\nHasbro adopted Prime Video advertising for a six-week test run in the UK, using Amazon first-party data to target parents. It found that two-thirds of Peppa Pig purchases during that period were new to the brand, adding that sales for those toy products on Amazon had increased 18 per cent, year on year.\\n“There is a sales pitch which has a buy one buy all, but when you get into it it's not quite there yet,” said another ad exec, pointing to the range of retail and video options as well as Twitch, the gaming platform. “But they will get there.”\\nAccording to Antenna’s Carson, the number of Prime subscribers who paid to opt out of ads was pretty substantial at first but quickly “trailed off”. At the end of May, less than a tenth had paid more for no advertising, they found.\\nOther streamers are also having success on their ad-supported tiers as cost-conscious consumers look at how many subscriptions they can maintain. Netflix has said that it has 40mn monthly active users globally on its ad tier, attracting between 40-50 per cent of new sign-ups.\\nAd plans had gone from 28 per cent to 38 per cent of the premium streaming market in the past two years, and made up more than half of gross additions for the first time in the last quarter of 2023, and first of 2024, according to Antenna.\\nThe focus on bolstering Prime Video’s financials marked a change from how Amazon had originally conceived of the streaming service, former company insiders said, seen at one time as a way to get consumers to sign up for the Prime subscription service.\\nAmazon’s Prime Video and Studios divisions were among those hit by lay-offs this year as the company sought to cut costs across the board and after big spending on blockbuster shows such as the Lord of the Rings series.\\nBut analysts and ad executives say there is more than enough content on Prime — new and old — to ensure that Amazon can take a dominant position in the market for advertising for streamers.\\n“It’s their playbook. Amazon has always been like a company that builds massive market share, then they monetise it,” said one ad executive. “You see they did that with ecommerce. They did that with cloud computing, and they’re now doing it with their ads business.”\", metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/d45c4153-6c11-4f1e-9009-62f8adf5ac2b', 'title': 'Amazon Prime Video undercuts rival Netflix on advertising prices', 'publication_time': '2024-07-30T04:00:28.402Z'}, uuid=UUID('4932d446-a379-4246-90fb-c03af01a6243'), db_id=''),\n",

Now it needs to win the advertising one.\\xa0That will be easier said than done.\\nThe company remains the undisputed leader in video streaming. Last week, it threw up another big quarter of subscriber and revenue growth, adding more than 8mn net new subscribers from April to June. Revenue rose 17 per cent to $9.6bn while net income jumped by nearly a third.\\nFuelling the growth was last year’s decision to crack down on password sharing and introduce a lower-priced subscriber plan with advertising. Hit shows such as Bridgerton and Baby Reindeer also helped attract viewers.\\nAt a time when rival streaming services are struggling to gain customers and make a profit, Netflix , with its 27 per cent operating margin and robust free cash flows, is the envy of the sector. Its shares have traded accordingly. The stock, up 35 per cent over the past 12 months, hit a new high this month. At about 30 times forward earnings, it commands a premium over rival streaming operators.\\nBut the subscriber surge from the password crackdown cannot last. User growth will slow. This could come as soon as the next quarter, with tougher comparatives from last year. Netflix plans to stop reporting quarterly subscriber numbers starting next year.\\nIt’s a questionable move that may backfire. Without insight into subscriber growth, investors will be forced to focus on other metrics. Netflix will need to start making more money from advertising to maintain its share price gains.\\nThe problem is Netflix is still a minnow in advertising. While YouTube and Amazon have well-oiled ad machines, Netflix is only starting to build its own ad-tech platform. Analysts at Emarketer forecast Netflix will generate $760mn in advertising revenue this year. That would translate into just a 2.7 per cent market share of the so-called connected TV ad business. Hulu and YouTube each have 12 per cent, while Amazon has 11 per cent.\\nNetflix’s cheaper, ad-supported tier has over 40mn global monthly active users. It needs to work harder to monetise these customers. That means showing more ads, or even introducing ads to its other ad-free tiers. At Amazon’s Prime Video, showing ads is the default mode. Customers have to pay more to avoid ads.\\nBut people pay for Amazon Prime for free delivery. Video is just gravy. Netflix customers will have less tolerance for ads, and for being asked to pay more to stay ad-free.

       "  (Document(text='\\nChloe Cornish in Dubai and Ahmed Al Omran in Jeddah\\nMedia group MBC is competing hard with Netflix to become the Middle East’s biggest streaming service, pushing a wide range of Arabic TV shows and films and its offer of free programmes supported by advertising.\\nThe Riyadh-listed entertainment company, which is majority owned by the Saudi government and is the region’s largest broadcaster, now commands 22 per cent of the Middle East and north Africa $1bn streaming market through its Shahid division. This puts it 4 per cent ahead of regional rival Starz Play Arabia and 5 per cent ahead of Netflix, according to industry analyst Omdia.\\nMBC has poured money into streaming in the past four years, pinning its hopes for growth on Shahid, which is not yet profitable, to cater for increasing viewer numbers, particularly in the oil-rich Gulf states. Shahid reported SR900mn ($240mn) in losses between 2020 and the first half of 2023.\\nTelevision is “not where we’re going to get the growth from”, MBC’s chief executive Sam Barnett told the Financial Times. “We’re getting similar [TV] viewership we had in previous years. We’re maintaining market share. It’s the media that is changing\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009we are seeing the shift of people to using [streaming].”\\nShahid says it now has 4.8mn paying subscribers in the region, while 20mn regularly watch its advertising-supported streaming service, which attracts viewers with long-running dramas such as Love Game , an Arabic version of a Turkish series about a woman’s attempts to marry a rich shoe designer to help her indebted brother.\\nBarnett said MBC had defied critics who said “the global streamers are coming to eat your lunch. You are this parochial Middle Eastern company. There’s no way you can stand up to\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009Netflix and Disney+ and HBO Max.”\\nThe shift from television to streaming has challenged broadcasters worldwide, but in a region lacking reliable TV audience data, it also presents an opportunity. Viewers in the Middle East’s more than 20 countries are polled only occasionally, often through surveys commissioned by media companies themselves. But streaming services allow media companies to see what customers are watching and how much advertising they are exposed to.\\nMBC’s streaming bet is also helped by demographics: more than 55 per cent of the Middle East and north Africa’s population are under 30, compared with 36 per cent across OECD countries. They are both digital savvy and keen for content, while expecting the same high production values they see on the likes of Netflix. To meet these expectations, Shahid is funding local talent as well as recruiting foreign producers and directors to make content.\\nBarnett described management’s approach to making new programmes as “constructively paranoid about everything”, adding that to try to keep spending at reasonable levels “I have all the creatives in the room, and then I sit them down with the accountants. And we have difficult meetings.”\\nThat approach appears to be working. Shahid lost SR6mn in the first three months of this year, but the figure is improving as subscription and advertising revenues rise. Losses for the same period last year were SR102mn. At the same time, revenues rose 72 per cent year on year to SR298mn, boosted by Ramadan falling in the first quarter. Families traditionally tune in to month-long TV series during that time, making it a top period for advertising spending.\\nKarim Sarkis, a media and entertainment specialist at consultancy Strategy&, said Shahid’s free streaming service and Arabic-language shows and films are helping it compete with Netflix.\\nThose anticipating that Netflix would commission large amounts of Arabic language content have been disappointed, Sarkis said, while “MBC have also woken up in the meantime\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009if they continue competing in the same way\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009I think the [long term] winner is going to be Shahid”.\\nFounded in London in 1991 as the Arab world’s first private satellite channel, the Middle East Broadcasting Corporation was an unusual commercial player in a regional media industry dominated by state-owned networks — that are crucial for projecting soft power — and billionaires’ vanity projects.\\nIts recent history has had TV-worthy moments of drama. In November 2017, founder and chair Waleed bin Ibrahim Al Ibrahim was caught up in an anti-corruption campaign orchestrated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, where hundreds of members of Saudi Arabia’s elites were detained in the Ritz-Carlton hotel and forced to transfer cash and assets to the government.\\nFollowing the incident, Ibrahim’s ownership fell from 100 to 40 per cent of the company while an investment company owned by the finance ministry took the other 60 per cent. It sold a part of that stake in an initial public offering last year and since the listing, MBC’s share price is up about 30 per cent to SR44.\\nThe government still owns more than half of MBC’s shares but Ibrahim retained the chairmanship and is actively involved in the business. Barnett said: “Like many big media moguls, he has strong opinions on content.”\\nGauging which shows will work is critical, Barnett said. Many countries in the region have strict content rules and some streamers have been rebuked by regional regulators for showing scenes such as same-sex kissing. In 2019, Netflix was forced to remove an episode of a comedy show after a complaint by Saudi Arabia, adding to concerns about political interference.\\nMBC and Shahid try “to approach the line, but not fall over it so you are alienating your audiences”, Barnett said, citing this year’s Kuwaiti drama Zawja Waheda La Takfi ( One Wife Is Not Enough ), which tackled the subject of polygamy.\\nBut some of Shahid’s original content has caused controversy. A mini-series on the 1988 hijacking of a Kuwaiti aircraft was pulled in response to protests from the country’s information ministry. The streamer also delayed showing a major television series in early 2021, based on the true story of a Saudi drug trafficker, after his tribe said it was insulting.\\nBeyond content, Shahid has tried to cater to the large and often multigenerational families in the region by allowing up to 20 devices to connect to each subscription.\\n“We are trying to establish what’s the right balance, because like all streamers, we also see abuse of password sharing,” said Natasha Matos-Hemingway, chief commercial, marketing and product officer of Shahid. However, “we’d be hurt very badly if we were to reduce [device allowances] to like two or three”.', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/c20b3bbc-b3a7-46c0-91ea-88e60501d922', 'title': 'How Saudi Arabia’s MBC came to dominate Middle East streaming', 'publication_time': '2024-07-07T04:00:28.440Z'}, uuid=UUID('13129d61-0b67-43bd-8522-a90f9569cbdc'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nRichard Waters\\nWhat do the game streaming service Twitch, music app Spotify and video streamer Max all have in common? This week, they all raised prices for at least some of their subscribers, joining what has come to feel like a stampede by digital services of all kinds in 2024 to charge more.\\nThere is no mystery behind this spate of price rises. Streaming may have become the preferred business model for large parts of the media industry, but for most it has also been chronically unprofitable — particularly in the video world, where it has put a severe dent in the multichannel TV model that was long a reliable money-spinner.\\nFor now, the pricing actions have not done much to depress subscriber numbers, encouraging some companies to push through more than one round of increases. But they signal that streaming is entering a new phase, where the headlong race for user growth is over and new forces will determine which comes out on top.\\nSpotify, founded 18 years ago, has yet to report a profitable year, while the chief executive of the 13-year-old Twitch, now a subsidiary of Amazon, also said in January that it loses money. Warner Bros Discovery, owner of Max, at least broke into the black in streaming last year, making it the first traditional media conglomerate to do so. But it made a negligible profit on more than $10bn of revenue.\\nOne notable thing about the higher subscription costs is that, at least until recently, most streamers chose to hold prices down in a race to attract users. Twitch, which raised the cost of its lowest subscription tier by 20 per cent, to $5.99 a month, had never had a price increase in the US before.\\nAfter dipping their toes in the water, though, some are starting to see price increases as a repeatable tactic. Spotify kept its subscription unchanged, at $10 a month, for more than a decade before raising it by $1 last year. This week, it announced another $1, with even bigger percentage increases for family and other premium subscription plans.\\nSpotify’s subscriber numbers have continued to rise strongly — one reason its stock price has soared fourfold since the start of last year. By 2031, Midia Research forecasts music streamers will be able to push through three more broad rounds of price increases, while also introducing new, higher-priced tiers of super-premium services.\\nTatiana Cirisano, senior music industry analyst at Midia, says music streaming has turned out to be a “stickier” service than many might have thought: subscribers tend to stay not just because of a familiar brand, but because they have spent time assembling playlists, while a service’s algorithms have learnt their preferences.\\nHigher prices are also set to usher in a new phase in the battle between digital services of all kinds. As consumers feel the pinch from paying for multiple high-priced premium services, getting a discount for buying a package of services starts to become more attractive — something that encourages the recreation of the very media bundles that standalone streaming services helped to destroy.\\nThis reflects a familiar pattern in the media business. Waves of unbundling, as old media packages are picked apart, are often followed by re-bundling. Consumers get more for a single payment — though one side-effect is that they also often end up, once again, paying for things they do not want. For media owners, meanwhile, selling a package also lowers overall customer acquisition costs and reduces churn of accounts.\\nIn video streaming, Disney has reported success with adding Hulu to its Disney+ video offering , and is planning to do the same with its ESPN+ sports service. Cross-company bundles are also in the works, with a Disney+, Hulu and Max subscription package promised for later this year.\\nAs these new media bundles start to form, new competitors will loom large. Amazon’s Prime, which combines video with free ecommerce deliveries, and Apple One, which includes six of the iPhone maker’s services, including iCloud storage, have shown Big Tech’s willingness to experiment with unconventional offerings that traditional media companies cannot match. Google has also included access to its latest AI models for some subscribers, though it has not gone as far in bundling all its subscription services together. The potential of these tech groups to combine many different types of services and to up-sell to their billions of users are likely to make them formidable competitors in the next phase of the streaming wars.\\nrichard.waters@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/e77d07d8-2997-40f3-b3ba-3577fb097368', 'title': 'The next phase of the streaming wars', 'publication_time': '2024-06-06T16:44:43.216Z'}, uuid=UUID('dc3ebc7f-343b-4f81-87ed-84aa8381d9be'), db_id=''),\n",

Controlling shareholder Shari Redstone favours a deal with David Ellison’s Skydance over joint interest from Sony and Apollo, pitting her against minority shareholders and prompting the departure of the CEO. But it also shows the climax is approaching in a longer-running industry drama. The likely sale of Paramount marks it out as the first big casualty of the streaming wars. It may not be the last.\\nWhen companies followed Netflix into streaming, market entry was straightforward. Technology companies like Apple leveraged their existing customer bases to lure subscribers, while venerated studios such as Warner Brothers built platforms for their intellectual property. All players used their existing profitable business lines — specifically cable TV for the media companies — and the favourable borrowing environment to finance flashy films and series.\\nThe road to profitability, however, has been more winding. Initial streaming losses were seen as an investment in market share. But streaming has also killed media companies’ golden goose, as consumers have “cut the cord” of cable TV in favour of subscriptions. In a rush to gain market share, Paramount, Warner Bros, and NBCUniversal have poured billions into streaming. With interest rates higher, subscriber growth slowing, and streaming losses mounting, Wall Street has now turned up the pressure on Hollywood.\\nDespite its ownership of marquee franchises such as The Godfather and Mission Impossible — which makes its studio attractive to buyers — Paramount has been weakened by the decline of cable and the billions it has invested into its late entrant into the streaming wars, Paramount+. The group’s debt rating was cut to junk by S&P in March. The fate of the subscale Paramount+ in any takeover is unclear. But other legacy media giants that have spent big on streaming platforms without turning profits may also now have to consider merging or selling them.\\nConsolidation has long been seen as inevitable in an crowded streaming market, but has its downsides. Hollywood is famous for its monopolistic tendencies, and having fewer players could further squeeze actors and writers, who went on strike last summer. Reorganisation may hasten the shrinking of the industry, pushing more people out of Tinseltown. It also threatens to lead to narrower choice and less abundant top-quality content for consumers, who have already seen streaming prices rise.\\nFor now, according to analysts, the smaller streaming players are trying to emulate the most successful, Netflix, by introducing new advertising tiers and by bulking up their content libraries. But with financial conditions drying up, spending across streaming has slowed from its Covid heyday. Streamers have started commissioning fewer titles and ordering a higher proportion of cheaper unscripted series, including reality shows and sports documentaries.\\nThey are also relying on existing IP to fill their content coffers, as buying popular franchises bears less financial risk than new commissions. Many critics have long lamented film studios’ overreliance on franchises. But as shown by Disney’s acquisition of Fox, Amazon’s purchase of MGM, and now the questions over what happens to Paramount+, the future of streaming may also be sequels and spin-offs.\\nThis highlights a new evolution in the streaming wars: streamers seem set to start looking more like the cable TV they displaced. Viewers were initially drawn to the likes of Netflix by the promise of advertisement-free original content.

At that time, KKR became a big shareholder in Mediawan while the French group took a 25 per cent stake in Leonine.\\nCapton, Mediawan’s CEO, said it was the right time for the companies to merge because European regulations were phasing in to require streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon’s Prime Video and Disney+ to spend more on locally produced shows.\\n“After France, Germany will next year become the second country to apply the EU directive to boost local content so it makes strategic sense to do this and work with Leonine to develop more premium content for streaming platforms,” he told the Financial Times.\\nPhilipp Freise, KKR’s co-head of European private equity, said the fund would continue to back Mediawan and expected it to do further acquisitions. “Together we have created the largest independent content production company in continental Europe. A next phase now begins with more deals to come to consolidate the space.”\\nStreaming platforms have lately been slowing their pace of spending on content globally as they shift focus to profitability over subscriber growth. The dynamic has put pressure on smaller producers, with some choosing to sell up and join larger groups such as Mediawan, to be in a better position to win commissions.\\nCapton said that Mediawan had experienced little impact from the streaming platforms cutting back, and pointed to Netflix’s recent disclosure that it now had more subscribers in Europe than in the US. “Streaming platforms are not necessarily spending less but they do want to spend better, meaning on fewer, higher quality shows,” he said.\\nMediawan was founded in 2015 by Capton, Niel and investment banker Matthieu Pigasse, as a special-purpose acquisition vehicle listed in Paris. The group, which also produced the series One Day , which was streamed on Netflix, has expanded steadily by snapping up small or mid-sized production houses in France and then across Europe.\\nIt entered the US in late 2022 by buying Brad Pitt’s Plan B Entertainment, an acclaimed Hollywood producer known for movies including Moonlight and Money Ball and more recently the hit Netflix science fiction show Three-Body Problem.\\nLeonine was founded in 2019 with KKR’s backing and has since been buying up production houses in Germany. It backed films such as The Lives of Others and Netflix’s Dark and owns the German-language rights for blockbuster franchises including John Wick.\\nOnce combined with Leonine, Mediawan will have about €1.3bn in annual revenues, compared with under €400mn when it went private in 2020.\\nIt has benefited from an EU directive adopted in 2018, gradually applied in member states, that requires a minimum 30 per cent of European works in the catalogues of streaming services. France went further in an effort to boost their cultural industries, and has required big global streamers to invest at least 20 per cent of their French turnover in European productions.\\n“We want to keep expanding in Europe, such as in the Nordics, and elsewhere where we are not as present, such as Africa where there is a lot of talent and opportunity,” said Capton.\\n', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/439a5c2c-f335-43cc-b2fa-f9d59b7f4b1c', 'title': '‘Call My Agent’ producer backed by KKR buys German rival', 'publication_time': '2024-04-28T17:00:10.966Z'}, uuid=UUID('030a2bbf-4efa-4f92-9806-cedd08fd2cbe'), db_id=''),\n",

They increasingly appear to be right.\\nEuropean competition authorities have largely dismissed the sector’s pleading as self-serving twaddle. The industry and its beleaguered investors are looking to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority — currently investigating a proposed tie-up between Vodafone’s UK operations and Three UK — for inklings of change.\\nIt is not difficult to see why the CMA plans a full inquiry into the proposed tie-up. Together, Vodafone and Three would create a mobile operator with 30 per cent of the UK market, just behind leader BT. The larger entity, the CMA fears, might be less motivated to compete aggressively than two relative minnows fighting for survival. A less fragmented market may also result in resellers such as Sky and Tesco Mobile paying more to piggyback on their networks, leading to higher prices for consumers.\\nThis misses one important point. Fierce competition has hammered the market’s economics. UK mobile revenues have fallen by 20 per cent in real terms in less than a decade, says Karen Egan at Enders, while data traffic is 30 times higher. Europe as a whole tells a similar tale. In Italy, the average price of one gigabyte of data fell by 85 per cent between 2019 and 2021, according to data compiled by Statista.\\nIn that kind of market, economies of scale are the only way to eke out a decent return on investment. Subscale network operators like Vodafone and Three cannot justify pouring any more money in.\\nThat’s a problem — for consumers and policymakers alike. Building evermore advanced telecoms networks is capital-intensive. Despite sucking in €59bn of investment last year, according to industry group ETNO, Europe’s 5G rollout is barely out of the starting gate. Completing it will require €400bn, according to the European Court of Auditors . The US and China are moving faster than Europe. The UK, in particular, is falling behind, with the worst download speeds in the group of G7 nations.\\nConsolidation would help. In the UK a merger between Vodafone and Three would cut operating costs, helping to nudge returns above the company’s cost of capital even absent a recovery in pricing. That would give the company an incentive to build a network that would otherwise not be available to consumers. The challenge for regulators is to ensure consolidation spurs better outcomes, rather than being a free pass.\\nIt could even give shareholders in the sector hope that its endless cycle of capital destruction might, eventually, come to an end.\\ncamilla.palladino@ft.com\\nLetter in response to this article :\\nWhy four-to-three mobile merger is bad for the UK / From Tommaso Valletti, Professor of Economics, Imperial College Business School, London SW7, UK', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/c1811185-45f9-4eef-85cb-7bbb012a104c', 'title': 'UK mobile merger must ring in changes for troubled sector', 'publication_time': '2024-03-26T13:00:40.475Z'}, uuid=UUID('b77c0bab-776b-49c5-8d96-1299b0828a8c'), db_id=''),\n",

By 2021, annual content spend in cash terms exceeded $17bn.\\nThe price Netflix paid for all that content was falling margins and a heavy debt load that exceeds $14bn.

The company’s market cap traded below Disney’s.\\nBy focusing on operating margins, Netflix has staged a comeback . It has cracked down on password sharing, promoted an advertising-supported subscription tier and raised prices.\\nBut the real change has come from cost cutting, aided by a writers’ strike in Hollywood that halted productions. While revenue rose 6.6 per cent in 2023, net income rose 20 per cent.

Activist investor Nelson Peltz says Disney’s streaming service should target “ Netflix-like margins ” of 15 to 20 per cent. This might be achieved by cutting back on content spend and licensing more content — two moves that would further serve Netflix.\\xa0Dearth of new content elsewhere may explain why Netflix is still adding new subscribers.\\nFor Netflix, this may still be a partial victory. Streaming remains an expensive business with low revenue per subscriber. YouTube is more popular than any streaming service and much of its content is created for free by users. Its revenue is mainly advertising, with subscriptions a bonus. The business is part of Google’s Services business, which boasts an operating margin of 35 per cent.\\nCompare Netflix with YouTube instead of Disney and the model looks altogether less appealing.\\nLex is the FT’s concise daily investment column.

It is set to pay TKO, WWE’s parent, $5bn over a decade. The Netflix deal will in effect make the streamer a landing page of various WWE content. The price is a steep increase over Raw’s current deal with Comcast’s USA Network.\\nMore importantly, this marks Netflix’s plunge into pricey live programming, an area it had long eschewed. News and sports had been the only content that kept traditional “linear” television afloat as a business model. Of the 100 top-rated programmes in the US, National Football League games account for 90 per cent, for example.\\nVince McMahon’s WWE is going to get its money. But the question is if Raw’s audience will comprehensively migrate to a pay-platform that charges at least $7 per month. After all, even as cord-cutting has chipped away at the pay TV audience, there are still some 50mn households paying for cable or satellite television.\\nThere has long been a tipping point expected where streaming will in effect kill off traditional consumption. Netflix is betting that moment has arrived.\\nNetflix has struck the Raw deal from a position of relative strength. Its shares are well below the all-time high prices hit in 2021 but have more than doubled from its trough. Subscriber growth has returned as it has cracked down on password sharing. Its operating margin is now at 20 per cent on the back of its new value tier which includes advertising.\\nDepending on the year, Netflix spends around $15bn on acquiring programming. It has avoided live sports both because of the high cost but also the technical and cultural challenges of combining streaming and sports.\\xa0Buffering can ruin the viewer experience; streaming is still predominately thought of as an on-demand, not by appointment, service.\\nThe taboo is fading fast. The NFL put a recent playoff game on NBC’s Peacock service that costs $6 per month. Fans grumbled but more than 20mn watched the game, a large number albeit smaller than a pure linear broadcast. Amazon Prime has also invested in Major League Baseball rights.\\nShares in TKO jumped by 15 per cent on Tuesday, implying a market value gain of $2bn. The National Basketball Association is the next major sports league looking to sign a new media contract. The hoops league will need to figure out the right mix of linear and streaming to\\xa0keep viewers on board.

She has held talks about selling the Hollywood studio to Skydance, the production company behind Top Gun: Maverick , people familiar with the matter say.\\nParamount chief executive Bob Bakish also discussed a possible combination over lunch with Warner CEO David Zaslav in mid-December. In both cases the discussions were said to be at an early stage and people familiar with the talks cautioned that a deal might not materialise.\\nBeyond their streaming losses, the traditional media groups are facing a weak advertising market, declining television revenues and higher production costs following the Hollywood strikes .\\nRich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners, said Paramount’s deal discussions were a reflection of the “complete and utter panic” in the industry.\\n“TV advertising is falling far short, cord-cutting is continuing to accelerate, sports costs are going up and the movie business is not performing,” he said. “Everything is going wrong that can go wrong. The only thing [the companies] know how to do to survive is try to merge and cut costs.”\\nBut as the traditional media owners struggle, Netflix, the tech group that pioneered the streaming model more than a decade ago, has emerged as the winner of the battle to reshape video distribution.\\n“For much of the past four years, the entertainment industry spent money like drunken sailors to fight the first salvos of the streaming wars,” Michael Nathanson, an analyst MoffettNathanson, wrote in November. “Now, we are finally starting to feel the hangover and the weight of the unpaid bar bill.”\\nFor companies that have been trying to compete with Netflix, Nathanson added, “the shakeout has begun”.\\nAfter a bumpy 2022, Netflix has set itself apart from rivals — most notably by being profitable. Earnings for its most recent quarter soared past Wall Street’s expectations as it added 9mn new subscribers — the strongest rise since early 2020, when Covid-19 lockdowns led to a jump.\\n“Netflix has pulled away,” says John Martin, co-founder of Pugilist Capital and former chief executive of Turner Broadcasting. For its rivals, he said, the question is “how do you create a viable streaming service with a viable business model? Because they’re not working.”\\nThe leading streaming services aggressively raised prices in 2023. Now, analysts, investors and executives predict consolidation could be ahead next year as some of the smaller services combine or bow out of the streaming wars.\\nWarner, home to HBO and the Warner Bros movie studio, has made a small profit at its US streaming services this year, in part by raising prices, aggressively culling some series and licensing others to Netflix. However, this has come at a price: Warner lost more than 2mn streaming subscribers in its two most recent quarters.\\nThe company, which merged with rival Discovery last year, has long been rumoured as a potential takeover candidate, with Comcast seen as the most likely buyer. But Zaslav in November hinted that his group wanted to be an acquirer instead of a target.\\n“There are a lot of\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009excess players in the market. So, this will give us a chance not only to fight to grow in the next year, but to have the kind of balance sheet and the kind of stability\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009that we could be really opportunistic over the next 12 to 24 months,” he said on an earnings call.\\nThe terms of the Warner-Discovery merger barred the group from dealmaking for two years. That period expires on April 8.\\nDisney, the largest traditional media company, is in the midst of a gutting restructuring that has featured 7,000 job cuts and attacks from activist investors. It lost more than $1.6bn from its streaming businesses in the first nine months of 2023, during which its Disney+ service gained 8mn subscribers. The company says it will turn a profit in streaming in late 2024.\\nBob Iger, Disney chief executive, this year openly pondered whether some of its assets still fit within the company, prompting speculation that he was considering disposals. But no deals emerged, leading some investors to conclude there is little appetite among private equity or tech companies for acquiring legacy businesses.\\nParamount’s shares have risen almost 40 per cent since early November as sale speculation mounted. The stock rose sharply after the Skydance talks were reported, but both Paramount and Warner shares fell after news of their discussions came to light.\\nAnalysts said the two companies’ high debt levels were an immediate concern for investors. “We suspect investors will focus on pro forma leverage above all else,” Citi analysts wrote in a note last week. They estimated that an all-stock combination of Warner and Paramount could yield at least $1bn of synergies.\\nBut Greenfield said merging two companies with lossmaking streaming services and large portfolios of declining television assets was not the answer to their problems.\\n“The right answer should be, let’s stop trying to be in the streaming business,” he said. “The answer is, let’s get smaller and focused and stop trying to be a huge company. Let’s dramatically shrink.”', metadata={'query': 'Comparative analysis with competitor streaming services', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/ec0f7996-fae9-4e80-baa9-020ad470c25a', 'title': '‘Shakeout has begun’ after $5bn streaming loss for Netflix rivals', 'publication_time': '2023-12-28T05:00:11.030Z'}, uuid=UUID('7b808340-ecc4-4aa0-90eb-2fb7e8e60676'), db_id=''),\n",

Ofwat has a year to review and decide the plans.\\nBills currently average £448 per household but vary by region and are adjusted for inflation each year. Severn Trent, which covers the Midlands and Wales, seeking to raise bills by 38 per cent, or around £139 per household, by 2030. Other companies such as Southern Water, which was criticised for discharging raw sewage and storm water near popular swimming beaches during the summer, are expected to announce even larger rises on Monday.\\nDavid Black, chief executive of Ofwat, sought to stave off a consumer backlash by reassuring households that they would “only pay for future investment, not to put right past failings”.\\n“As families struggle with higher household bills it is important that the much needed improvements in performance and investment offer customers value for money,” he added.\\nHe insisted that the regulator would hold companies to account by incentivising delivery, and imposing financial penalties on those that fail.\\nThérèse Coffey, environment secretary, said: “I have been very clear with Ofwat, the regulator, that\\xa0customers should not pay the price for poor performance and they should use the full powers we have given them on behalf of consumers.”\\nBut there are increasing concerns that the regulator and government’s punitive language and hefty fines will deter investors. The companies are burdened with £60bn of debt — up from zero at privatisation — and although equity injections have been rare since privatisation, many have been asking shareholders for cash.\\nDominic Nash, analyst at Barclays Research, said: “Investment in the water sector should not be taken for granted. We believe recent Ofwat and Defra announcements have increased risk for investors and could lead to less investment\\xa0in the sector, rather\\xa0than more.”\\nIn 2020, four water companies had their appeals upheld by the Competition and Markets Authority after Ofwat rejected parts of their initial plans. The regulator was concerned that the companies would carry out the investments more cheaply, which under the complicated regulatory system allows them to divert some of the excess to shareholders, a clutch of private equity, pension and sovereign wealth funds. Many experts expect a repeat of the appeals process next year.\\nFeargal Sharkey, a water campaigner, said: “The question is what’s\\xa0happened to our money? Where has it gone? If they had used the cash to deal with sewage and build some reservoirs they wouldn’t be asking for such big increases now.”\\nLetter in response to this report: Water industry headlines, an awkward balancing act / From Patricia Rodrigues Jenner, Emma FitzGerald and Shefaly Yogendra', metadata={'query': 'User response to added fees for household additions', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/f92df631-4bae-4995-81cc-66028c62edfb', 'title': 'Bills set to soar as UK water companies seek record £96bn spending', 'publication_time': '2023-10-01T23:01:09.154Z'}, uuid=UUID('4b24fe12-8c10-48ae-9347-7129fc7b4f3c'), db_id=''),\n",

But many other retail, hospitality and service businesses are borrowing from this price-inflating playbook.\\nIn fact, close to half of all purchases involve the addition of at least one extra (but necessary) fee, according to an independent study published this week by Alma Economics, a public policy consultancy, that analysed over 500 UK websites and apps.\\nIt found the worst examples of drip pricing were associated with buying event tickets (93 per cent of providers), cinemas (69 per cent) and even gym memberships (60 per cent).\\nOne gym chain pumped up prices with a mandatory joining fee that made up 39 per cent of the base price.\\nIt’s also impossible to tell what many hidden charges are actually for, given the catch-all nature of terms like “admin fee”, “processing fee” or “service charge”.\\nFrankly, “extra profit” would be a more accurate description.\\n“If you knew the final price up front, the question is: would you have a different decision,” says Nick Spyropoulos, Alma’s managing director.\\nOverall, drip fees added a median 6 per cent to the advertised base price, according to Alma .\\nScale this up across the wider online consumer marketplace, and these small yet annoying charges could add up to £3.5bn of additional annual spending — the last thing we need in a cost of living crisis.\\nKeen to crack down on the causes of inflation, the Department for Business has launched a consultation about how best to slow the drip, drip, drip of unfair pricing.\\nI expect they will receive a torrent of replies.\\nNot all the extra charges people resent having to fork out for relate to online purchases. Consider, for example, being stung by “optional” service charges in restaurants of 12.5 per cent or more. Suffice to say, few diners have the chutzpah to ask for this to be removed, even if they receive terrible service.\\nOrdering food via online delivery apps is another area where extra charges added at the end of the process really sticks in the craw.\\nAnd many will have gripes about Airbnb (“the price on the map looks OK, then when you go to book admin fees and cleaning charges are applied”).\\nPlenty of drivers rage about admin fees charged by digital parking apps. Car hire companies upselling expensive insurance add-ons at the last-minute is another thing that drives people mad.\\nAnd even if you haven’t bought a flight, simply dropping someone off at Stansted airport costs an eye-watering £7 for 15 minutes .\\nThese extra charges are clearly something that really annoy people, but the main issue here is transparency. If material pricing information is being withheld, it makes it harder for consumers to compare the true costs, so we risk making a suboptimal purchasing decision.\\nFrom a behavioural point of view, it’s no coincidence these extra charges are dripped in very late in the process. By the time the final price is revealed, psychologically, we’re more committed to buying whatever it is, and thus more likely to proceed (albeit through gritted teeth). Abandoning our basket and starting again also costs more of our precious time.\\nFollowing the consultation, how might ministers try to remedy this?\\nThere’s certainly scope within the existing regulations for the Competition and Markets Authority to crack down on the worst of these charges, but some argue there are too many grey areas, and the rules need to be properly updated for the digital era.\\nCitizens Advice, the independent consumer watchdog, wants to see “new fit-for-purpose regulations and clear obligations for retailers” when it comes to website or app design.\\nFew would agree that the corporate world needs another awards ceremony, but an annual event (The Drips?) to name and shame the most egregious examples is one way consumers could stage a fight back.\\nNomination categories could include The Biggest Drip, Most Pointlessly Named Charge and the Droplet Award for multiple extra pricing add-ons.\\nAnd there wouldn’t be an admin fee charged for handing out the gongs.\\nclaer.barrett@ft.com\\nClaer Barrett is the FT’s consumer editor and the author of ‘ What They Don’t Teach You About Money ’. claer.barrett@ft.com Instagram @Claerb', metadata={'query': 'User response to added fees for household additions', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/44ae564c-2758-415f-9728-20a8bc092ffb', 'title': '‘Drip pricing’ is a scandal', 'publication_time': '2023-09-08T14:30:50.376Z'}, uuid=UUID('f227a655-f501-43f1-b62a-bf26e493dbb3'), db_id=''),\n",

The report also recommended “streamlining” the planning and regulatory process.\\nThese measures would help halve the 14 years it takes on average to build new electricity transmission projects, he added.\\nThe proposed shift away from fossil fuels towards wind turbines, heat pumps and electric cars as part of the drive to hit the UK’s net zero targets by 2050 requires a huge expansion of the electricity grid to move the power to where it is needed.\\nNational Grid, the FTSE 100 owner of Britain’s transmission network, called on the government earlier this year to reform the planning system to cope with the planned overhaul. It has estimated that five times as much work on the network will be needed over the next seven years than was undertaken over the past three decades.\\nThe increase in development risks triggering new tensions over plans to decarbonise the economy, with campaigners already raising concerns about the local impact of new pylons, overhead power lines and underground high-voltage cabling.\\nWinser said there was a precedent for the lump sum payments. “That wouldn’t be that dissimilar in my mind to the sort of compensation we already use for infrastructure classes, like roads for example.” Homeowners can already apply for compensation if the value of their property is hit by new road developments or expansion projects.\\nWinser declined to put a figure on the size of the compensation payments for households but said there was an “opportunity for those benefits to be generous”. He also recommended offering funding to affected communities.\\nHe noted it costs significantly less to build an overhead line compared with an underground line with the difference as much as £1mn per km\\xa0and £9mn per km, respectively.\\nTom Glover, UK chair for RWE, the UK’s largest power generator, said halving the time took to build out the network “would be a game-changer for the industry and the country”.\\nWinser’s report comes as the government faces criticism over the pace of progress towards its legally binding target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\\nRecommended\\nEarlier this week, the House of Commons science, innovation and technology committee said ministers lacked a strategy to achieve its aim of tripling Britain’s nuclear power generating capacity.

Colleagues of Shapps have said he would welcome Winser’s proposals\\nSir John Armitt, chair of the National Infrastructure Commission, welcomed the report, adding: “We need transformational change in our electricity network to support the government’s ambitious offshore wind plans and to support decarbonised heating and electric vehicles.”\\nWhere climate change meets business, markets and politics.

The Bank of England has projected that 1mn UK households face paying £500 or more extra a month as they roll off fixed-rate mortgage deals between now and 2026.\\nAverage mortgage rates have hit a 15-year high, surpassing levels seen in the aftermath of the Truss-Kwarteng “mini”-Budget last year. Lenders are standing by to help struggling borrowers but many hope to budget their way out of trouble by relinquishing luxuries from their low-rates-era lifestyle.\\nTrying to decide what will be cut — and by whom — is complicated further by the British reluctance to talk openly about money, elevating the potential for disagreements at home and within families.\\nFinancial tensions within relationships are of course nothing new, but the squeeze on budgets is widening existing faultlines. When I asked people about their budgeting gripes this week, simmering levels of financial resentment were already obvious.\\nTop of the list is wage rage. Wishing a spouse or partner would push for a pay rise or promotion or get a better-paying job is seen as the solution by many (better not tell Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, who is troubled by UK pay growth hitting a record high). Even so, a higher rate taxpayer would need a gross salary increase of more than £10,000 to fill a £500-a-month hole in their budget.\\nProfligacy is another common moan. Many tell me their own efforts to economise are being undone by a higher spending spouse — men and women complained equally about this, although the sources of tension varied.\\nA linked issue was how to split rising bills if one partner earns more than the other. “Dividing our expenses 50:50 is so unfair when he makes more than double what I do,” said one person (I heartily agree).\\nDonate to the Financial Literacy & Inclusion Campaign here\\nAs pressures grow, so will the need for difficult conversations at home. People tell me they suspect their partners of having secret savings or credit card debts or confess to such concealments, fearing this may weigh on future mortgage refinancing options.\\nIt is also notable that mortgage-driven budgeting pain is skewed towards younger generations who have taken on much bigger debts to get on to the property ladder. As first homes are often followed by first babies, rising childcare costs add significantly to the burden.\\n“It feels like a big snowball is rolling down the mountainside towards us, and we’re just braced for it to hit,” says one young couple. Agonisingly, they know their mortgage repayments will jump from £800 to £1,400 a month when their fixed-rate deal ends in November; a timeframe that unfortunately coincides with the arrival of their first child.\\nOlder homeowners, by contrast, are more likely to be mortgage free. Plenty will have already helped their adult children to buy a home; offspring unable to balance budgets may approach the Bank of Mum and Dad for a bailout, risking further financial disagreements between siblings or generations.\\nVicky Reynal, a psychotherapist who specialises in helping people resolve financial problems, notes that conflict often arises from an imbalance somewhere. This could be one sibling receiving more financial help than another; one person within a relationship earning or spending more, or even a power imbalance in financial decision making.\\nArguments might appear to be about money on the surface, she says, but they’re really about what money has come to symbolise: namely, our desires — and fears — around security, power, control and love.\\nTalking more openly about money is one way of easing the tension. Tamsin Caine, a chartered financial planner at Smart Divorce, works with couples whose relationships with money (and each other) have reached breaking point. “It’s very common for one person to deal with the money in a relationship, but this creates a whole extra layer of fear for the other person when couples divorce,” she says.\\nOf course, the financial pressures are far more acute for singletons.\\xa0While a partner’s spending habits could be a source of friction, at least you can face the mortgage music together.\\xa0We might struggle to find the right words, or the right time to confront our money problems when they surface. But the more you do it, the easier it becomes.\\nAs challenging as it is to find a good compromise or a better balance, open conversations about money and financial decision-making now will help everyone when interest rates recede.\\nThe writer is the FT’s consumer editor and the author of “What They Don’t Teach You About Money”. claer.barrett@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'User response to added fees for household additions', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a85c264c-1190-4f0a-b260-7e3081611ca5', 'title': 'It pays to open up about mortgage pain', 'publication_time': '2023-07-14T13:31:10.386Z'}, uuid=UUID('d9cc4469-0a53-4d5b-a9be-44d3fb1362c6'), db_id=''),\n",

With childcare costs eating up the bulk of their disposable income, finding hundreds of pounds extra every month is a grim prospect.\\nI have received anguished messages from Money Clinic podcast listeners in this predicament who worry they will no longer pass lenders’ affordability tests when the time comes to remortgage. So here’s my cut-out-and-keep “don’t panic” guide to navigating what’s to come.\\nFirst, stating the bleeding obvious, however scary this is, you must plan ahead. When fixes end, borrowers are shifted on to their lender’s SVR (standard variable rate) and most of these are 8 per cent and rising. This figure is commonly used in the “illustrative example” letters that lenders send out. Yet if you agree a new deal, you’ll be able to access lower rates.\\nWhat’s more, the vast majority of lenders have pledged to offer existing customers a new deal without undertaking further affordability checks. This is thanks to a deal brokered by regulators last December. So long as you are up to date with your mortgage payments, and are not extending the length of your mortgage or amount borrowed, this will be possible.\\nBrokers say the rates that banks have been offering to existing customers are competitive and not far off those offered to new customers. They can track down the best deals if you do switch lender, although striking any new loan agreement will require affordability tests.\\nDo you have questions about UK mortgage rates, high inflation, and rising interest rates? Our consumer editor Claer Barrett will join Adrian Anderson, director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, and Sarah Pennells, consumer finance specialist at Royal London to answer your questions. Click here\\nAssuming you can pass these and still have a few months until your current deal expires, switching lender could offer a bit more flexibility. A broker can help you lock into a fix with a new lender ahead of time, but switch to a better deal — without penalty — if one becomes available. This could be a useful insurance policy if rates on longer fixes do fall in coming months (well, we can dream).\\nYet for many, the monthly repayments are still going to be unaffordable.\\n“Understandably, people are terrified that their house will be repossessed, but that is the last thing mortgage lenders want to do,” reassures Sara Williams, a former debt adviser, better known online as Debt Camel .\\n“Contacting your lender to discuss your options will not impact your credit score. However, if you’re really scared, talk to a debt adviser first so you’re prepared for the call.”\\nThey can help you go through all of your income and expenses to work out a budget, and can also advise on reducing other unsecured debts such as credit cards. Williams recommends the free “Your Budget” tool on the National Debtline website, which usefully converts weekly and annual payments to a printable monthly budget.\\n“For the vast majority of people, your mortgage lender will have help to offer you, but if you know your\\xa0budget first you can be more confident about talking to them,” she says.\\nAccording to UK Finance, the financial services trade body, the most commonly offered solution now is an arrangement under which borrowers are allowed to make lower monthly payments for a set period, with the arrears added to their loan. Having been done with your lender’s agreement, they won’t chase you for these debts — although it will affect your credit score.\\nCredit scores can be rebuilt in time, but people I’ve spoken to on radio phone-ins this week worry greatly about how this could affect their future refinancing options.\\nUnder an agreement with lenders on Friday, customers will also be permitted to switch to an interest-only mortgage for six months, or extend the term of their mortgage to flatten out monthly repayments. Neither will require affordability checks, or affect people’s credit scores - although they will add to long-term borrowing costs.\\nThe help lenders offer will depend on your individual circumstances, so the exact deals borrowers at different banks will be able to secure will vary. This is an area regulators need to watch very carefully.\\nFor all the assurances about forbearance that lenders are making, it is vital that borrowers have rapid access to an independent arbitrator if they dispute their bank’s decision.\\nAs the banks ramp up lending rates, there will be cries of moral hazard if they fail to increase savings rates too\\nWhy? Just look at the lottery that scam victims have faced in terms of how fraud reimbursement rules are applied by different banks. Some get their money back; others have to go through a lengthy complaints process involving the Financial Ombudsman before the banks pay up — and an alarmingly high number of cases are upheld.\\nWhen a potential house sale or repossession is hanging in the balance, speed is of the essence. Yes, there will be tough decisions ahead, but the public needs to have confidence that these will be fair decisions.\\nWhile the headlines this week have focused on homeowners, we cannot forget about the financial pressures on renters.\\nNearly 2mn households renting privately rely on benefits to cover some of the costs, yet local housing allowance rates have been frozen since 2020. The IFS estimates this freeze will save the government £650mn in the current tax year, a shortfall funded by those on the lowest incomes.\\nSpiralling rents are sapping the finances of higher-earning tenants too. Some have given up saving for a housing deposit altogether. This week, it was revealed that under-40s saving into Lifetime Isa accounts incurred penalty charges of nearly £50mn by raiding their savings early. It’s understandable that the 25 per cent government bonus must be forfeited, but it’s sickening they lose a chunk of their own savings on top.\\nIf you’re in the happier position of being able to use your savings to overpay your mortgage before your fixed rate expires, a final tip. You will have much more flexibility if you stash any cash in the highest interest rate savings account you can find , rather than pay it directly to your lender.\\nAs the banks ramp up lending rates, there will be cries of moral hazard if they fail to increase savings rates too.\\nWhen the time comes, you could use this to pay off a chunk of the mortgage before striking your next deal, but crucially, you could still access the cash in an emergency.

First, it ignores the socially regressive effect that “anticipatory investment” in the grid to meet future capacity needs may have on low-income households. Second, it ignores the risk of investment being anticipated wrongly (which is why Ofgem has been cautious about this approach). Not only will any inefficient investment increase the already high fixed cost element of bills that are passed on to consumers, but it will also disproportionately affect low-income households who consume less energy and whose bills are a high proportion of earnings.\\nThe issue of net zero isn’t therefore about Ofgem’s role, but about reforming tariffs so that buyers who consume energy above certain levels pay a higher unit price. In an integrated electricity system, this reform would avoid low-income households having to shoulder the burden of fixed-cost investments should they turn out to be stranded assets when the anticipation is wrong or when demand for grid connections is reduced because of lower consumption and higher efficiency or when consumers go “off grid”.\\nSimon Holden Edinburgh, UK', metadata={'query': 'User response to added fees for household additions', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/595e1679-5749-49c3-870a-056ee0620aad', 'title': 'Letter: Electricity tariff reform can protect poorer households', 'publication_time': '2023-05-10T23:00:15.048Z'}, uuid=UUID('a0c99096-79e6-4394-816c-942f5a1a388d'), db_id=''),\n",

What about a contribution to your mortgage? How about $1mn towards a new interior?\\nAs property markets falter across the UK, Europe and the US, homebuilders are going to ever greater lengths to get buyers to commit to a purchase.\\nIn February, 34-year-old New Yorker Agata bought a new-build home in Brooklyn. Aside from negotiating $50,000 off the $545,000 list price, her buying agent also got the developer to pay most of the 4.5 per cent state property sales tax.\\n“Without the concessions, I would have been on the fence,” she says. “The home didn’t feel like a slam dunk and it felt like a buyer’s market: if I didn’t go for this one another would come around.”\\n“People are trying to put deals together and concessions are a great way to make it happen,” says Ryan Serhant, a top-end estate agent in Manhattan. “Although a lot are not made public.”\\nSerhant recently worked on the sale of a home listed for $66mn in which the developer paid just under $1mn towards the New York mansion tax (a surcharge\\xa0levied on the city’s high-value homes) and, he claims, included $1mn interior design credit.\\n“Many more\\xa0brokers and developers are offering mortgage ‘buydowns’ to reduce the impact of higher mortgage rates,” says Drew Boland of Proper Rate, a Chicago mortgage broker.\\nMortgage buydowns, where\\xa0developers pay lenders a lump sum to reduce buyers’ mortgage repayments, have become widespread in the US. In\\xa0December, 75 per cent of homebuilders offered the incentive, according to a survey by\\xa0John Burns Real Estate Consulting, a housing research company. Helped by the measure, total new home sales increased by 7.2 per cent in January compared with December, while second-hand home sales fell 0.7 per cent.\\n“From nothing a year ago, incentives are now common,” says\\xa0Peter Rabitz, a Berlin-based estate agent who specialises in selling high-end properties. On West Side Sky Suites, a development he is selling in the popular Charlottenburg neighbourhood, the developer is offering a new kitchen, a fireplace and property tax payments worth up to €197,400.\\n“Affordability constraints mean that very few of London’s new homes are sold to local individuals without a major incentive,” according to a January report by Molior London, which tracks the new-build property market.\\nSince March, on its development in Bexleyheath, south-east London — where the cheapest home is a one-bedroom apartment for £285,000 — housebuilder Bellway has been offering buyers £1,000 per month towards their mortgage costs for up to the first year.\\nSteve Mariner, group sales and marketing director at Barratt Developments, the UK’s biggest housebuilder, says the company is currently offering incentives, such as mortgage and deposit contributions and help with buyers’ moving costs, worth up to £30,000.\\nOffering “sweeteners” is nothing new. Back in 2017, The Telegraph newspaper reported how the contents of a luxurious show flat near Hyde Park — worth £400,000 — were included in the sale of a £9.5mn penthouse. The vendor of a £25mn mansion in Mayfair threw in a Rolls-Royce Phantom, worth £350,000, to get his buyer to commit.\\nBut why offer incentives at all? As property prices decline and new-build sales fall — down 38 per cent in London in the past year, and 56 per cent across Manhattan and Brooklyn — why don’t developers simply start lowering the price of their homes?\\n“Developers are trying not to cannibalise future sales by setting a lower price bar, or alienate earlier buyers with visible discounts,” says Jonathan Miller, professor of market analysis at Columbia University in New York.\\n“They don’t want a lot of owners with posters outside their homes complaining they [overpaid],” says Neal Hudson, a UK housing market analyst and founder of BuiltPlace.\\nThere is a more fundamental reason, too.\\xa0“Price is essential,” says\\xa0Thomas Zabel of Savills in Berlin. “That\\xa0is what the developers have to report to the banks who are funding [them].” Falling sale prices could result in housebuilders having to renegotiate their financing and may involve paying higher borrowing rates or provide more equity.\\nDespite the disadvantages of\\xa0lowering their\\xa0prices, some housebuilders see no alternative. In Berlin, developers are quietly asking agencies to come back with offers, says Rabitz. The average price on the “small handful” of apartments that he has sold in the past six months in Berlin is between 10 per cent and 12 per cent below list price.\\n“On West Side Sky Suites, prices range between €1.59mn and €3.29mn — but the seller will be happy to negotiate,” he says.\\nThe average discount of a new home sold in Manhattan in January and February was 1.7 per cent below listing price, according to PropQuery.\\nIndividual sales are going for much bigger discounts. In September last year, an apartment at\\xa035 Hudson Yards sold for just over $35mn. Its original asking price was $59mn.\\nIn the UK, incentives are effectively limited by the finance disclosure form, which must be submitted to the mortgage lender. Too many incentives and the bank will drop its valuation of the home, and the amount it is willing to lend. “There’s a rule of thumb among developers that they can’t really give more than about 5 per cent or 6 per cent in kind,” says Richard Donnell, head of research at Zoopla, a property portal.\\nBut should buyers ever be tempted by sweeteners?\\n“If you have a mortgage, certainly not,” says Henry Pryor, a UK buying agent. “Never accept the show home perks or the stamp duty payment; you’ll be paying for it in your mortgage over 25 years. If you’re being offered inducements, clearly there’s a deal to be done on the price.”\\nAt the current rate for the average\\xa0five-year fixed mortgage of 4.97 per cent, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, that “free kitchen” worth £20,000, would cost £994 per year more in mortgage payments than if the £20,000 was cut from the purchase price.\\nNever accept show home perks. If you’re offered inducements, clearly there’s a deal to be done on price\\nEven for cash buyers, a developer’s offer to pay the purchase tax on a home will have a smaller financial benefit than reducing the headline price, since sales taxes are calculated on that amount.\\nFalling sales are only part of the problem developers face: rising inflation, supply chain issues and higher interest rates have pushed up the costs of building and financing new projects.\\xa0“It’s the perfect storm for developers,” says Garrett Derderian, a New York-based housing analyst.\\n“In Germany, the very low margins our developers work on make rising costs for materials and finance particularly difficult,” says Rabitz. Zabel says one\\xa0luxury developer in Hamburg, which he declined to name, has just\\xa0bought back the four units it had sold off-plan to buyers, so that it can cancel the project entirely.\\nOn top of repaying the buyers’ deposits — which ranged from €150,000 to €300,000 — the developer paid each buyer between €70,000 and €175,000 to cancel the contracts and reimburse purchase taxes and other costs. “It was very expensive, but the developer knew that he would lose much more if he went through with the development and tried to sell into this market,” says Zabel.\\nIn the UK, tighter planning rules are only adding to the costs. Last\\xa0October, the Home Builders Federation (HBF) said that changes to tax and regulation would add £20,000 to the cost of building a new home by 2025. Yet more regulations have followed: in December, it was announced that residential buildings over 30 metres in height will require two staircases — a response to the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people in 2017. In February,\\xa0the London mayor Sadiq Khan\\xa0announced new air-quality regulations that will impact developers.\\nDeteriorating economics have been reducing supply for several years. In 2022, 18,067 homes were started in London, down from a post-financial crisis peak of 33,775 in 2015, according to Molior London. With adverse conditions for developers set to endure, this trend is likely to continue.\\n“As prices fall and costs increase, [the major] developers mothball sites, waiting for prices to recover — that reduces housing supply,” says Darren Baxter,\\xa0housing policy adviser at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which lobbies to address housing poverty.\\nHousebuilders’ falling profits will reduce their appetite for building in the future, he says. In October, Barratt Developments issued a profit warning.\\xa0“The sector already has a shortage of construction staff: if developers address falling profits by laying off staff, this will reduce their ability to build homes [even further],” says Baxter.\\nIn the year to September 2022, planning approvals for new housing developments fell in 11 out of 12 regions in England and Wales, compared to a year earlier, according to the HBF.\\nThe withdrawal of the government’s Help to Buy scheme in England\\xa0from October 31\\xa0last year is likely to accelerate the falls. Estate agency Savills predicts that new-home sales will drop from 145,000 in 2022 to 90,000 in 2023.\\n“In London, there have been very few planning applications for new developments this year,” says Sam Long of Molior London.\\nIn 2019, 32 per cent of London homes were bought using Help to Buy, according to Molior. Without it, more homebuilding will be concentrated in areas already unaffordable for most Londoners, as developers look to corporate landlords and overseas buyers.\\n“The positive thing about Help to Buy was that it opened up much wider areas for regeneration,” says Long. So-called “build-to-rent” operators favour locations, such as those near Tube stations, that are already popular and expensive. “And the next big hope for developers is selling overseas, which means areas with a history, that people in Hong Kong and Singapore can Google easily,” he adds.\\nAs prices fall and costs increase, developers mothball sites — that reduces housing supply\\nThe European build-to-rent market has taken off in recent years, with investors pouring in €399bn since 2013, according to Knight Frank.\\nA decade ago, corporate landlords bought about 8 per cent of new homes in London, according to Molior. In the last three months of 2022, of the 3,234 sales that took place in the city’s top-selling schemes they bought 1,295, or 40 per cent of the total. Overseas buyers bought another 1,053; and just 298 went to individual UK buyers (including the last of those to use Help to Buy).\\nIn Berlin,\\xa0overseas buyers have evaporated.\\xa0“In 2021, we sold an entire development on a roadshow to Beijing and Singapore,” says Zabel. “Today, we wouldn’t consider a tour. The demand is zero: I have colleagues in Hong Kong telling me please don’t send us developments, our customers aren’t interested.”\\nAs home ownership in Europe’s cities moves beyond the budget of many residents, the growing concentration of urban homes in the hands of large corporate landlords is a cause for concern among housing campaigners who claim they provide expensive flats that do not address the housing affordability crisis.\\n“Big profit-driven corporations and investors cannot be relied upon to own and manage large blocks of flats for the benefit of tenants,” says Leilani Farha, who was the UN special rapporteur on the right to housing until 2020, and today campaigns on housing rights.\\nIn a September 2021 referendum, Berlin residents voted for the forced purchase of up to 240,000 properties belonging to large corporate landlords, to turn them into affordable housing. As yet, there remains no legal means to do this.\\nBack in Brooklyn, incentives offered by developers keen to avoid cutting their prices remain common. Sandy Abbas, the agent who found Agata her home, starts all negotiations in that neighbourhood asking for 4 per cent of the sale price in concessions.\\nBut price cuts continue. Back in December, Agata rejected one home she liked when the developer refused to cut its $525,000 price tag. “By the time I completed my purchase in February, I saw it was under contract for $495,000,” she says.\\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow @FTProperty on Twitter or @ft_houseandhome on Instagram', metadata={'query': 'User response to added fees for household additions', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1a6a54a4-516f-4530-bc53-460ec456c7c9', 'title': 'Could a ‘sweetener’ tempt you to buy a new home?', 'publication_time': '2023-03-24T05:00:57.569Z'}, uuid=UUID('99f1b6ad-a82c-4579-977d-521e3693adb4'), db_id=''),\n",

The £40,000 cap on tax-free annual pension contributions — frozen for nine years — is rising to £60,000.\\nThe £1.073mn tax-free lifetime allowance on pension pots is being scrapped. The chancellor went further than pre-Budget leaks which suggested he might raise the limit to £1.8mn. He said: “No one should be pushed out of the workforce for tax reasons.”\\nFor those who have stopped work and ceased pension contributions and now wish to resume paying into a defined contribution pot, the money purchase annual allowance (MPAA) will rise from £4,000 to £10,000.\\nFor very high earners, the so-called taper rules will be eased to allow for increased tax-efficient pension savings. Currently, taxpayers lose £1 of annual allowance for each £2 of “adjusted income” above £240,000. This threshold will rise to £260,000.\\nFree childcare for working parents in England is being extended from three- and four-year-olds to children aged from nine months up to their third birthday. Available for up to 30 hours a week, it will be implemented in stages by September 2025.\\nFamilies on universal credit will receive childcare support up front, instead of having to claim it back later, and will see an increase in the £646 monthly limit per child to £951 for one child and £1,632 for two children. The government will also increase the funding that nurseries receive for the free hours, addressing the concerns of providers, which have insisted the money they receive per hour fails to cover costs. Meanwhile, after-hours care for school-age children will be expanded.\\nOn energy , the price guarantee capping typical annual household energy bills at £2,500 will be extended for a further three months to the end of June — worth £160 in total for a typical household.\\nSo households won’t feel the full force of Ofgem’s price cap — which stands at £3,280 — for these three months. The Treasury says lower wholesale gas prices are expected to feed through to lower household energy bills from July, when Cornwall Insight data suggests the Ofgem price cap will drop to an estimated £2,100 a year for a typical household.\\nAlso, the energy premium for prepayment meters will be scrapped from July, saving 4mn poorer families £45 a year. Charges will be comparable to direct debit energy charges, says the government.\\nHowever, with inflation increases outstripping pay rises, the impact of income taxes will rise in real terms. Thresholds are not being lifted, so more people will pay income tax at basic and higher rates\\u2009than before, as they are frozen until 2028.\\nAs previously announced, the yearly capital gains tax-free allowance will halve to £6,000 from April, and to £3,000 in 2024, when those liable for CGT will pay up to £2,604 more than in the current tax year.\\nThe allowance for dividends will drop too from £2,000 to £1,000 in the new tax year, then to £500 from April 2024, bringing it to one-tenth of the £5,000 allowance when it was introduced in 2016.\\nAlcohol duty will be affected by a number of changes announced in the budget. To help pubs, the chancellor increased draught relief, meaning taxes on draught beer and cider will be up to 11p lower than the duty on similar products in supermarkets. This will also apply to pubs in Northern Ireland because of the Windsor framework.\\nThe chancellor also confirmed that from August alcohol duty will be increased in line with inflation, ending a years-long freeze on the tax. From August, the government is also set to introduce its long-awaited new alcohol taxation system, which will charge alcohol duty according to the strength of drinks across the board, increasing taxes on stronger red wines and ciders. Tobacco duty will also be uprated.\\nFuel duty will be frozen for another year, with the chancellor extending a 5p per litre cut introduced last year in the wake of rising prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\\nThe chancellor is scrapping a planned rise under the fuel duty “escalator”, which was intended to raise the levy every year, but has been frozen every year since 2011. The Treasury estimates the measures will save the average motorist £100 in a year. Fuel duty is 52.95p per litre.\\nThe promotion of tax avoidance schemes to contractors, freelancers and temporary workers will become a potentially criminal offence under proposals laid out in the Budget.\\nThe government said this would help up to 2.4mn contractors who could unwittingly become involved in tax avoidance through the agencies they trust to handle their tax affairs, only later to face thousands of pounds in unexpected future tax bills and penalties as a result.\\nNational Savings & Investments , the government-backed savings bank, has been asked to target issuing £7.5bn worth of premium and savings bonds in 2023-24, as the Treasury attempts to broaden its funding sources.\\nReported by Mary McDougall, Peter Campbell, Oliver Barnes, Lucy Warwick-Ching, Bethan Staton, James Pickford and Stefan Wagstyl', metadata={'query': 'User response to added fees for household additions', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/811a5572-67c2-477f-bc17-8e17e6bda7e5', 'title': 'Budget 2023: what it means for your money', 'publication_time': '2023-03-15T14:38:07.384Z'}, uuid=UUID('e4081ac8-2786-4b80-b6a7-74031d83be73'), db_id=''),\n",

He is also likely to increase the funding providers receive for places, according to people close to discussions.\\nThe drive to make childcare more affordable and accessible comes as Hunt seeks to reverse a rise in labour inactivity by making it easier for parents to work.\\nAt present, parents of three and four-year-olds can claim 15 or 30 hours of free childcare a week during term-time, but the entitlement is not universally available for younger children.\\nPlans first reported by The Guardian will extend the entitlement to parents of one- and two-year-olds. But it remains to be seen over what timescale the expansion will take place, or whether funding will be reallocated from other areas of early years spending.\\nThe government will also increase the funding nurseries receive for the free hours, addressing the concerns of providers, which insist the amount they receive per hour falls far short of their costs.\\nResearch by the Early Years Alliance, a trade body, found the government in 2021 gave nurseries approximately £4.90 for each funded hour, despite estimating that it would cost about £7.50 per hour per child to provide care.\\nEYA head Neil Leitch said underfunding had left the system “on its knees”. While a £4bn commitment sounded “impressive”, he said the “devil is in the detail”, and that an expansion would be unsustainable if the government did not significantly increase per-hour funding.\\nIf money for more places did not match “sharply rising” costs of providers, “what is currently a crisis will end up in catastrophe”, he added.\\nProviders have previously called for the free hours system to be totally overhauled, something Labour has committed to if it wins the next election.\\nPeople close to discussions said the government would commit an extra £200mn to existing hourly entitlements in 2023-24, rising to closer to £300mn the next year.\\nThe increase will top up funding that in 2021-22 amounted to about £4bn — an increase of about 5 per cent next year.\\nThe government will also offer new self-employed childminders a bonus of £500, or £1,000 if they join through an agency, and relax ratio rules enabling one adult to look after five two-year-olds, up from four children under-three at present.\\nHunt on Sunday said he would reform the universal credit benefits system to allow parents to claim support for childcare upfront, rather than in arrears.

       "  (Document(text='\\nJim Pickard in London\\nProperty groups, charities and the Church of England have urged the UK government to amend proposed changes to England’s planning system, warning that they risk causing a “significant reduction” in affordable housing provision.\\nIn a letter seen by the Financial Times, groups including the National Housing Federation, British Property Federation, Shelter, Crisis and the Church told levelling-up secretary Michael Gove that a new levy to fund cheaper properties could worsen “pre-existing pressures” around supply.\\nOne of the aims of the levelling-up bill, now going through parliament, is to overhaul the way developers fund local infrastructure improvements as part of their planning negotiations with local councils.\\nAt present, “Section 106 agreements” mean developers negotiate with councils over their provision of local amenities, such as schools and clinics, in return for permission to build property.\\nDevelopers’ payments run into billions of pounds annually, with affordable housing accounting for 78 per cent of spending in the 2018-19 fiscal year.\\nThe levelling-up bill plans to replace these payments with a sweeping “infrastructure levy” that will raise money for local authorities to fund affordable housing as well as infrastructure and non-infrastructure spending on “local services”.\\nIn their letter, the groups said the proposed levy “risks a significant reduction in the delivery of affordable housing and homes for social rent through the planning system”.\\nIt “could lead to the diversion of developer contributions away from affordable and social housing and towards other, unspecified forms of expenditure entirely unconnected to development”, they wrote.\\nThe groups are backing amendments to the bill put forward by Labour peer Lady Diana Warwick and the cross-bencher Lord Richard Best, a housing expert.\\nOne of Warwick’s amendments would prevent receipts from the infrastructure levy being spent on anything “other than infrastructure”, while Best is proposing mandating that 75 per cent of the levy be spent on affordable housing.

       "  (Document(text='\\nLucy Warwick-Ching\\nI have had an offer accepted on a house built in 2016 in London. I’d be the second owner, but my conveyancer has spotted an “estate rentcharge”, which I’m told mandates freeholders to pay what seems to be a service charge for maintaining the estate grounds. The company that manages the charge isn’t providing the information our conveyancer is requesting. The commitment is circa £150 a year, but I’m worried about it increasing year-on-year. How does an estate rentcharge work and can increases be challenged?\\nSophie Maryan, head of real estate residential in the London office of JMW Solicitors, says estate rentcharges are permitted by the Rentcharges Act 1977 and are payable by the property owner to the rentcharge owner, which is usually the developer or a company set up to manage the estate. The property owners on the estate may have a share in the company. If this is the case, you would have some say in how the estate is managed.\\nEstate rentcharges come in two forms: a fixed estate rentcharge, usually a nominal sum such as £1; and a variable estate rentcharge, which is similar to a service charge on a leasehold property and is a contribution towards upkeep of communal areas on the estate, for example, landscaping, lighting, roads and so on. This cost will vary year-on-year.\\nThere are three main differences between a service charge on a leasehold property and an estate rentcharge. First, unlike service charges for a leasehold property, there is no requirement for a formal consultation process for major works.\\xa0Second, there is currently no statutory mechanism to challenge the level of charges imposed by the rentcharge owner, other than to bring court proceedings.\\nFinally, there is no requirement on a rentcharge owner to serve a notice on the homeowner or lender giving them a reasonable period to remedy a breach, nor is there a right for the homeowner to apply to the courts for relief. This is problematic because if an estate rentcharge is unpaid the rentcharge owner can take possession of the property or grant a lease of the property to a trustee.\\nThe rentcharge owner should provide an FME1 form when the property is being sold with information relating to the estate charges. Although this is not a legal requirement, it is standard practice under the conveyancing protocol and mortgage lenders may insist on this. We would recommend you gather as much information as possible in relation to the charges and potential increases.\\nThough the only way to challenge charges is to bring court proceedings, there are limits on what can be charged, which does provide some protection.\\xa0If the estate rentcharge was created under the Rentcharge Act 1977 the rent may be more than a nominal figure, but must represent a reasonable payment for the performance by the rent owner of the covenant.\\nThe government has considered legislative reform to estate rentcharges, however little progress has been made to date.\\nMy wife and I have decided that we need some time living apart and we plan to separate imminently. We have been together for 38 years, married for 36, and our children are grown up and have left home.\\xa0I plan to move out of the family home soon, and I wonder if there are any steps I should take now to protect my position? I am the financial breadwinner and my wife has been a homemaker throughout our marriage. We are both in our late fifties.\\nHenrietta Thomas, partner at Burgess Mee Family Law, says separation is emotionally stressful. You may feel your life is in limbo because you are unsure whether your marriage can be saved, but there are some simple steps you can take now to help manage your separation, whatever the outcome.\\nPrepare emotionally. Time apart could either prompt a reconciliation or cement your view that your marriage is over, but in the interim you should focus on effective, measured communication with your wife — and your children — despite the challenging circumstances. Build an emotional support network: let friends know what you are going through, and consider couples counselling with your wife or individual therapy sessions.\\nPlan financially. The most immediate concern when separating is where you will live. Since you plan to leave the family home, you may need to rent alternative accommodation and budget accordingly. As the breadwinner, you probably pay the bills for the family home, and you should continue to do so until you reach a financial settlement.\\nConduct a financial inventory covering your respective income and liabilities, outgoings, capital and pension positions. Consider your interim and longer-term financial needs and perhaps each agree a fixed monthly budget and agree not to spend significant sums of joint funds without each other’s consent. If you already make monthly payments to your wife, these can persist if they meet her financial needs.\\nTake screenshots of bank balances at the time of separation and ask financial institutions to require both your signatures for withdrawals from savings or investment accounts. Depending on the length of the separation, subject to legal counsel, you might consider ring-fencing any bonuses you receive from work.\\nTake specialist advice. Moving out of the matrimonial home involves legal and tax considerations, including capital gains tax implications if your absence is prolonged. If you ultimately pursue a divorce, your wife will be potentially living alone in a large house with little incentive to reach a financial settlement, particularly if it necessitates the property’s sale.\\nSo obtain family law advice about divorce and its financial aspects sooner rather than later, but note the statutory requirement for a marriage to have “irretrievably broken down” before a divorce application can be brought. Consider the various modes of resolution available, including solicitor-led negotiations, mediation, collaborative law and single lawyer advice.\\nAs for the financial settlement, England and Wales is a discretionary jurisdiction; the family courts provide a bespoke solution according to each case’s facts. The court will view the contributions of a wife and mother as equal (although different) to those of a primary breadwinner. The starting point will be to divide matrimonial assets equally, unless either parties’ needs dictate otherwise.\\nYou will also need specialist advice regarding the appropriate division of any pensions, in line with the Pensions Advisory Group’s recommendations, to achieve equality of income given your proximities to retirement age.\\nThe opinions in this column are intended for general information purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional advice.

Companies should be offering credit or debt advice, with pre-pay installations a last resort, he said.\\nSpeaking at an event held by the Institute for Government think-tank, Brearley also called for a “serious assessment” of a cheaper social tariff for low-income households, which would mean those that were least able to pay were charged a lower price for their power.\\nCurrent rules require suppliers to explore the financial help on offer or carry out appropriate assessments before they can forcibly install prepayment meters or remotely switch a household’s smart meter to a pre-pay tariff.\\nBut Brearley said some people were being moved “without even knowing about it”. He cited an example of a customer in Glasgow who “left to go on holiday and returned to find he’d been switched to pre-pay without his knowledge and had no way to top up”.\\n“Although there is good practice in many places, no company came through [in initial investigations] without needing to improve and all have been required to submit plans to meet the standards we set,” Brearley said.\\nThe government has introduced an energy price guarantee scheme aimed at restricting a typical household bill to about £2,500 a year until the end of March, and to about £3,000 until spring 2024.\\nAlthough wholesale gas prices have been falling, Brearley said it was unlikely that prices would return to pre-pandemic levels and that new approaches were needed in Britain’s energy sector.\\nEnergy UK, which represents the industry, said: “Suppliers are already required to have exhausted all other options before installing a prepayment meter by warrant.”\\nRecommended\\nThe comments came as National Grid confirmed on Monday that it was planning to pay some households that use smart meters to use less power today and tomorrow in what will be the first time it has used a new scheme designed to help prevent power shortages.\\nMore than a million households and business are signed up to the Demand Flexibility Service, which rewards people, usually via money off their bills, for turning off appliances such as ovens and dishwashers during a specific period when electricity demand is high.\\nThe service is expected to run from 5pm to 6pm on Monday and between 4.30pm and 6pm on Tuesday.

       "  (Document(text='\\nNathalie Thomas , Energy Correspondent\\nBritish households struggling with the cost of living crisis will draw some comfort this winter from the fact government subsidies are taking some of the edge off eye-watering energy bills.\\nBut large energy suppliers and fuel poverty campaigners are urging ministers to engage in an “open and frank” conversation about how to tackle high energy costs in future years, particularly for the most vulnerable, as analysts caution that wholesale gas prices may not return to “normality” before 2030.\\n“It’s unsustainable for the government to be subsidising every household’s energy for a long, long time,” said Carl Packman, head of corporate engagement at the campaign group Fair By Design.\\nCompanies including Eon and EDF Energy have joined fuel poverty campaigners in calling for the government to accelerate consultations over the introduction of a “social tariff”, or another kind of discounted rate that would provide more help to the poorest households.\\nThey are also urging wider market reforms — including overhauling a system where the cost of gas in effect sets the electricity price, irrespective if it is generated by cheap, green sources, such as wind — as high energy bills threaten to put a strain on household budgets for several more years. They also want a greater government focus on making Britain’s housing stock more energy efficient.\\n“We are calling for the government to have these kinds of discussions,” said Philippe Commaret, managing director for customers at EDF Energy, one of the top six energy suppliers in Britain , adding that an “open and frank” conversation would be required between the energy industry, regulator, ministers and charities to determine which households should continue to receive help from the taxpayer.\\nUntil the end of March, the government’s so-called energy price guarantee (EPG) scheme caps the price per unit of electricity and gas for all households so that a “typical” household pays about £2,500 a year on average. Without that subsidy, the figure would have been nearly £4,300 a year from January 1, as dictated by the energy price cap that is set by Ofgem, Britain’s energy regulator, every three months.\\nMinisters have already said subsidies would continue after April for a further 12 months at a reduced level, so a typical household bill would be limited to £3,000 a year should Ofgem’s price cap, which is dictated by prices in the wholesale energy markets, remain above that level.\\nEnergy consultancy Cornwall Insight warned last month that gas prices were “unlikely to return to pre-2021 ‘normality’ this decade”. And although there are signs of some relief — analysts this week revised their forecasts for October’s price cap down to between £2,700 to £2,800 reflecting a fall in wholesale prices in recent months — many households are still likely to struggle to pay their energy bills over the next few winters at those inflated levels.\\nThe government has already warned it could not subsidise energy bills for all households “indefinitely”, which adds to the urgency of wider reforms, according to Packman. He said with energy prices forecast to remain high for years to come there had “to be a more sustainable option and a social tariff which would target\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009those at the sharpest end of the cost of living crisis”.\\nThe Treasury said it was working with consumer groups and the energy industry on a number of options to best protect consumers beyond April 2024, including social tariffs. “No decisions have been made at this stage,” it added.\\nDevising a more targeted scheme is challenging. There are unresolved questions for the government over the funding of a social tariff — neither option of using general taxation or adding a levy to all other domestic bills are palatable in the current climate — and which households should benefit.\\nBut there are examples both abroad and in other industries that could act as a guide, said Simon Virley, head of energy and natural resources at KPMG. “There is no reason why a social tariff can’t be applied to the [British] energy market, as we already see them used in other sectors, such as broadband, as well as other countries, like Belgium.”\\nCommaret said a more “targeted” EPG “could be a way to have a kind of social tariff”.\\nBut Michael Lewis, chief executive of Eon, believes a more urgent intervention may be needed, given millions of households are likely to struggle next winter even if forecasts for bills are coming down.\\nEon is pushing for the existing support scheme to be replaced next winter by an alternative mechanism known as a “rising block tariff”, which subsidises consumption up to a certain level. This would offer smaller households, which should cover the most vulnerable, much cheaper bills, while the more affluent living in larger properties would have to shoulder more of the costs.\\n“Broadly speaking there is a correlation with energy consumption and wealth so you can subsidise the first block of average consumption at a very reduced rate, the second block might increase but it’s still subsidised but beyond that it’s not subsidised at all,” explained Lewis.\\nRecommended\\n“It means everyone can get the basic energy at a cheap level, it also encourages people to economise\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009It’s a fairer way of distributing the cost of [government support].”\\nUltimately, though, “putting continuous support on bills is a little bit of a plaster”, said Mari Martiskainen, professor of energy and society\\xa0at the University of Sussex Business School, who called on the government to tackle the problem of Britain’s inefficient housing stock, which is among the worst in Europe.\\nThe government has committed to providing £6bn in funding for three years but not until 2025 as part of a “new long-term commitment to drive improvements in energy efficiency to bring down bills for households, businesses and the public sector”. For many this is far too late.\\n“Imagine if we could provide people with a really warm home to begin with, how much that would impact their quality of life and then have wider long-term implications,” said Martiskainen.\\n“We’re talking about things like the NHS\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009if people had fewer illnesses [caused by living in cold homes] we can be using NHS services less.”', metadata={'query': 'User response to added fees for household additions', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/72cd7111-8306-4840-92af-7bd4b6f99b1c', 'title': '‘Social tariff’ needed in Britain as high energy bills set to endure', 'publication_time': '2023-01-05T17:00:37.005Z'}, uuid=UUID('35b19f75-2e2c-438c-be74-5af834cac115'), db_id=''),\n",

The Treasury said it would be looking at a five-year CPI+1 deal, but added: “The consultation will also seek views on other potential options to give greater certainty, such as providing a 10-year settlement.”\\nThe move is designed to stimulate the building of more affordable homes by providing certainty over cash flow for heavily indebted housing associations and councils.

It was also well above the 2.5 per cent rate across the general population and compared with headline inflation of 2 per cent in June.\\nHouseholds in private rental accommodation saw costs increase at an annual rate of 3.2 per cent in the same period, according to the ONS. By contrast, costs for people who owned their property outright rose 1.3 per cent, the lowest of any group calculated by the statistics agency.\\nThe figures point to the challenges facing Sir Keir Starmer to deliver his promise of a “decade of national renewal” and leave behind the cost of living crisis of the past three years.\\nMinisters are meeting energy company executives on Wednesday to discuss plans for the winter and are separately set to extend a critical hardship fund to help struggling households in England, according to Whitehall officials.\\nBut the prime minister on Tuesday gave his strongest signal yet that taxes would rise in the Autumn Budget , warning that the fiscal event was “going to be painful” and that he would have to make “big asks” of the public.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nThe ONS data offers a closer measure of households’ experience of living costs than the headline inflation index. This is because the figures are based on how much different types of households spend on goods and services, rather than the fixed basket used to measure headline price growth.\\nThey also take into account the costs incurred by households from changes in mortgage interest rates, stamp duty and other spending related to the purchase of a dwelling, which are not included in the headline rate.\\nMortgage costs have surged since the end of 2021 after the Bank of England raised interest rates from an all-time low of 0.1 per cent to a 16-year high of 5.25 per cent last summer in a bid to tame high inflation.\\nIn August, the BoE cut its benchmark rate to 5 per cent for the first time since Covid-19 struck, and financial markets expect another reduction in November.\\nTomasz Wieladek, chief European economist at the investment company T Rowe Price, said the ONS data showed the BoE’s monetary policy stance was squeezing household disposable income, with effects “not picked up in consumer price inflation”.\\nLandlords with mortgages passing higher borrowing costs on to tenants contributed to the higher inflation rate for renters compared with the general population. A lack of properties is also pushing up rents, which are still rising at near-record rates .\\nBut in a sign of an easing in the cost of living, the 2.5 per cent reading for annual growth in household costs marked a steep slowdown from a peak of 12.7 per cent in October 2022.\\nEnergy and food costs have fallen since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 led them to surge, and industry data showed shop prices entered deflation for the first time in almost three years this month.\\nThe impact of the swings in energy costs was reflected in the inflation rate experienced by retired people, who spend a bigger share of their income on gas and electricity bills.\\nAnnual inflation for retired households stood at 1.2 per cent in June, down from 1.4 per cent in May and a peak of 14.3 per cent in October 2022.\\nHigh mortgage costs and falling energy prices also widened the gap in inflation rates between richer and poorer households.\\nThe richest 10 per cent of the population faced an inflation rate of 3.3 per cent in the year to June, while costs for the poorest 10 per cent rose by 1.7 per cent, the ONS said.\", metadata={'query': 'User response to added fees for household additions', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/5c383479-7c83-4db7-b75d-4f14c7f1c6a0', 'title': 'UK mortgage holders and renters hit hardest by inflation', 'publication_time': '2024-08-28T11:17:30.331Z'}, uuid=UUID('ed4c2185-3327-4846-ad0a-77d04e6a98c1'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nRobert Shrimsley\\nI’m sure we’ve all had those moments. They are staring back at you with a look of sullen non-cooperation, and you think, “Right then, it’s time to bleed the lazy freeloader.” And then the questions kick in. Is seven too young?\\nSo, first, we should establish how old they are. Seven is probably a little young and they may not be earning much. Unless you want to be reimbursed in gummy bears purchased with the pocket money you gave them, this may not prove the income stream you imagine.\\nOn the other hand, this is the age when they are most demanding so, in terms of service provision and landlord obligations, it may be the moment to strike. Alternatively, you could go for some kind of minimum-service obligation with top-up fees for additional extras. Even so, you may want to consider extracting your early-years rent in the form of chores. The advantage of this is that you condition the spawn young to the rent principle. You might review this again at, say, 14, though, even then, the income stream is likely to be minimal and you have to consider the possibility of having the notion thrown back at you as you reach your dotage.\\nAside from household chores, we are probably talking about adult working-age children. Either they’ve left school and got a job or they are back from university and working or, possibly, they are supposed to be looking for a job, but appear to your jaundiced eye not to be putting enough effort into the search.\\nAnyway, the answer to this issue lies with two fundamental questions. 1. How much do you need the money? And 2. How desperate are you to get rid of them? If money is an issue and they are earning, then it is reasonable to ask for a contribution. Or perhaps you don’t exactly need the money but feel that some offering towards room and board is still merited. That’s fine too.\\nAssuming, though, that money is not the central consideration, then we come back to question two. How keen are you to be shot of them? Because once you get above a relatively modest charge, you are pretty much challenging them to shove off. As a tactic for freeing up the house, I recommend it. If you want a new study, a walk-in closet or just somewhere else to dump the clutter, you know what to do.\\nThe other issue, frankly, is that once you make them pay, the relationship clearly changes. What once were obligations to you are now their rights as a tenant. And we need to think about legislative changes. Labour has promised to end “no-fault” evictions. Once you start charging, you may never be able to get them out. Admittedly, as a parent, you are genetically engineered to find fault with your children but this may not be the kind of fault that stands up at a tribunal.\\nObviously, if the goal is to ease the loafers out of the family home then you need to go for something above market rates so that they could actually save money by moving in with mates. This should free up a room within two or three months. Although, in certain parts of the country, such as London, that might mean gouging the spawn for a four-figure sum each month. On the other hand, think of the holidays for two that gets you. I’m talking Orient Express level here.\\nAgain, though, with that level of rent comes certain obligations. Your tenant will expect the shared rooms to be maintained to a high standard and will not expect to give way when you need the bathroom. The dinosaur mural on their bedroom might need painting over. They will be entitled to complain about broadband speeds or noise when they are trying to sleep. And they won’t feel under any obligation to chip in when you need a favour, walking the dog, waiting in for the plumber and so on. You may want to factor in a domestic-duties discount to ensure they remain amenable to such demands.\\nCharging is generally tricky. Children might feel entitled to some kind of loyalty discount for the long years of patronage. They are also a known quantity, which must be worth something, except, clearly, on those occasions when it isn’t.\\nOn balance, I take the view that they will be gone soon enough so no need to speed the process. Should you feel differently, the path to your walk-in closet is just a couple of rent cheques away.\\nFollow @FTMag to find out about our latest stories first and subscribe to our podcast Life and Art wherever you listen', metadata={'query': 'User response to added fees for household additions', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/9334af86-47df-40a0-998b-c7d68591e942', 'title': 'Ask Shrimsley: should I charge my children rent?', 'publication_time': '2024-06-28T10:00:27.990Z'}, uuid=UUID('d9c615fc-1b83-404e-ad28-6b7b036b4c51'), db_id=''),\n",

Doing both will mean a faster (and greener) solution. Underused housing space is not just in flashy new tower blocks with no lights on at night. There is much more in ordinary homes. My and my colleagues’ research shows that second, third and further spare bedrooms create 17 per cent of all housing CO₂ in England, and add a similar chunk to bills.\\nSome people in bigger homes want to use space better — to save money, earn rent or downsize — but can’t.

While half of readers still intend to make this their priority, since 2022, there has been a 15 per cent drop in the proportion saying this. However, many plan to increase their pension contributions to avoid the “£100,000 tax trap” of high marginal rates and the loss of childcare benefits.\\n“Despite consistent salary increases for me and my partner, our outgoings — especially our mortgage — have increased at a higher rate. We are poorer now than we were five years ago,” said one reader.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nSmaller bonuses at banks have been driven by a sustained slump in dealmaking activity. A less competitive recruitment market also means employers are prepared to risk handing staff smaller bonuses, or even a doughnut — a bonus of zero.\\nWhile 42 per cent of readers expect their bonus to be higher than last year, many complain that their base salary has not risen, while day-to-day living costs have rocketed.\\nOne FT reader wrote: “Childcare spending is my number one financial priority. We can’t afford a holiday this year, despite having a joint household income of £165,000.”\\nThe increasing cost of servicing a mortgage was the biggest worry driving readers’ financial decisions, but growing numbers of high earners tell us that they are borrowing to sustain the lifestyle to which they have become accustomed.\\nWhether you expect to receive a bonus or not this year, the results of our 2024 survey offer valuable insights on how to manage your money in challenging times, as well as investing for the future in the most tax-efficient way.\\nThe three Rs — remortgaging, redundancy fears and rebuilding cash buffers — are this year’s stand-out themes.\\nIn their detailed responses about the reasons behind their cash allocation decisions, many readers spoke of the “guaranteed return on paying down debt”.\\n“Both myself and my husband work in the financial sector, and are acutely aware that our roles aren’t secure. We want to use our bonuses to pay off our mortgage when our fixed-rate ends,” one survey respondent said.\\nWhile paying your mortgage off early will save you interest, unlike many investments, it does not have the added benefit of tax relief.\\nThree cheers for the reader who told us she is sticking to the strategy of investing her bonus every year: “It’s the best way to gradually increase my wealth.”\\nHowever, many others confessed they found it a challenge to live off their salary alone. Instead of investing the bulk of their bonus, as has been the trend in past reader surveys, this cash is increasingly needed to meet day-to-day living costs.\\nAs one reader put it: “I got a bonus, but have received no pay rise for the past two years. The increased cost of living is eating up my base salary and I’m no longer able to save.”\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nRebuilding cash buffers is of increased priority, with 21 per cent of readers opting to keep their bonus cash in a savings account, up from 18 per cent in 2022.\\nWhen we asked these readers what specific goal they were saving towards, the biggest group (39 per cent) said they simply wanted to have more cash on hand to cope with whatever the year ahead might bring. One in four said they were saving to buy a property, and nearly one in five said they were saving to pay off a lump sum of their mortgage when their fixed-rate deal expired.\\nDoing this would have the added bonus of reducing monthly costs, notes Jason Hollands, managing director at Evelyn Partners, a wealth manager. “That could free up capacity to make regular monthly investments again going forward — the two are not mutually exclusive,” he says.\\nSaving to cover the cost of child-related expenses — particularly if the Labour party wins the election and adds value added tax to private school fees — was the fifth most popular reason for saving.\\nWhile the Bank of England bides its time cutting interest rates, it is possible to get more than 5 per cent in a savings account. However, quite a few readers told us they were investing their medium-term savings pot in short-dated gilts in the hope of getting a better return over a longer period. Capital gains on gilts are tax-free, unlike interest on cash savings outside of an Isa.\\nClearly, investing has become a luxury for some. But given the size of some of the bonuses paid, it is not surprising that the majority of FT readers surveyed still intend to invest at least some of their cash.\\nThe biggest group of survey respondents work in banking and finance in the UK, but there were also detailed responses from professionals working in law, tech, energy and consulting.\\n“The data on the size of bonuses suggests employers are being more aggressive in how they allocate their bonus pools this year, indicating a greater focus on really rewarding those who they see as vital to retain,” Hollands says.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nWhen we asked readers how they intended to invest their cash, once again, investing using stocks and shares Isas was the number one choice — though far fewer are in a position to take full advantage of the £20,000 annual Isa allowance. This year, only one-third said they would invest using Isas, compared with more than half of respondents to our 2023 survey.\\nPensions moved from third place last year to 2024’s second most popular choice, thanks to the chancellor increasing the annual allowance from £40,000 to £60,000 (see below). But with more readers saying they want to keep more cash on hand, not everyone can afford to be this tax efficient and lock up their money inside a pension for the long term.\\nAdam Walkom, a financial planner and partner at Permanent Wealth Partners, has lots of clients who are City workers in their 30s and 40s. Many bought bigger houses and moved out of London in the “race for space” during the pandemic.\\n“When the interest rate on your million pound mortgage jumps to 5 per cent, that makes a big difference to your life,” he says. “For the last two years now, I’ve seen a real switch away from taking bonus money and investing for the future to people refocusing and saying, actually, I want to de-risk and take that mortgage down.”\\nFrozen thresholds mean increasingly punitive rates of personal taxation are another huge factor in bonus decisions — especially for readers north of the border.\\nAvoiding the £100,000 tax trap was the fourth most common reason cited by readers in their detailed answers. The tapering of the personal allowance results in a 62 per cent marginal tax rate — if national insurance is included — on the band of income between £100,000 and £125,140 as well as the loss of any state childcare entitlement.\\nMany readers told us they were using salary sacrifice to increase their pension contributions, and keep their income below this level.\\nThe larger pensions annual allowance of £60,000 gives readers more scope to cut their tax bills and boost their retirement prospects. Although they will have to pay tax on pension withdrawals, money invested can grow tax free, and a quarter can be taken as a tax-free lump sum. Yet there were clear signs of dissatisfaction that this £100,000 threshold has remained frozen since 2009.\\n“My entire bonus is caught in 62 per cent marginal tax territory, so it’s not worth accessing it,” commented one reader, adding: “It’s not big enough to make a meaningful difference to my lifestyle or cash flow.”\\nAnother reader put it more bluntly: “I’m fed up of working for the government.”\\nRecommended\\nPeople in Scotland face an even tighter squeeze, with 45 per cent income tax rates kicking in at a much lower threshold of £75,000 — a difference dubbed the “Tartan Tax”. That rises to 48 per cent on income above £125,140.\\nOne Scottish reader maxing out his pension says: “I’m planning to retire earlier as I’m getting more annoyed at the constant raising of taxes.” However, the strategy of pension stuffing to avoid bigger tax bills is not flexible if your circumstances change.\\n“Pensions are a fantastic wealth-building tool over the long term, but any money that goes into a pension, you can’t touch until you’re 55 or older,” warns Walkom. “The tax savings are great, but funnelling all of your bonus into a pension when, actually, you’re going to need that money for living is not the best idea.”\\nHe advises readers to “take a step back” and think about short-term and long-term priorities. For those who fear redundancy, this could include building a bigger emergency savings pot. “Think strategically about the planning element first, and let that drive the investment strategy.”\\nOne financial change that Labour has said it will not reverse if it wins power is the government’s decision last November to scrap the banker bonus cap . Over the years, the cap led to banks paying much higher salaries and smaller bonuses, reversing the traditional pattern — though this has given readers more financial security in tougher times. So has the removal of the bonus cap had an impact?\\n“Not yet” was the most popular answer of respondents working in UK banking — but in this transitional period, many felt changes were happening by stealth.\\n“My salary has been frozen for two years, and I’m expecting my bonus will form a greater part of my pay in future,” was one typical response.\\nReaders working for UK banks felt bosses were unlikely to risk cutting salaries for existing employees — but as base salaries plateau, higher inflation means their pay is going backwards in real terms.\\nSeveral said their employers had communicated that cap-related changes for the next bonus round will be announced in the summer. But few bankers are likely to welcome these changes.\\nWhen asked which scenario they preferred, unsurprisingly, four out of five FT readers voted for safety over glory, saying they would favour a high base salary and a limited bonus, as opposed to a low base salary and an unlimited bonus.\\n“We’ll only really know the answer when we get a stonking year for financial markets with lots of M&A and lots of IPOs,” says Hollands. “That’s when the relaxation of the banker bonus cap will show if the good times are well and truly back.”\\nFor many years, higher earners faced tight restrictions on how much they could invest into pensions — but this year’s survey shows nearly one in four respondents who intend to invest their payout will “pension their bonus” to take advantage of valuable tax reliefs, up from one in five readers a year previously.\\nSince chancellor Jeremy Hunt increased the annual allowance in the Budget last year, it is possible to make up to £60,000 gross pension contributions and receive tax relief. For increasing numbers of readers whose bonus pushes them into the £100,000 “tax trap” or above £125,150, where 45 per cent income tax is applied, this is an attractive prospect.\\n“I’ve put everything over £100,000 into my pension and have utilised the last three years of tax allowances on top, using carry forward rules,” one reader told us, adding: “I fully expect the larger £60,000 pension allowance to disappear under Labour.”\\nOne in four FT readers said that they would pay more into their pensions this tax year as a result of the enlarged annual allowance, and abolition of the lifetime allowance (LTA). However, 6 per cent of readers said that although they could afford to invest more into pensions, they were holding off through fear a future Labour government would reverse the LTA changes.\\n“Check with your employer to see if you can use salary sacrifice to invest your bonus into your pension,” says Nimesh Shah, chief executive of Blick Rothenberg. “This can give some additional relief for national insurance, and your employer may also share any employer’s national insurance savings with you in an additional contribution to your pension.”\\nHowever, he points out: “If you have adjusted income of more than £260,000, your annual allowance will be reduced and can be restricted to £10,000.”\\nAt these income levels, Venture Capital Trusts and Enterprise Investment Schemes may appeal. They offer 30 per cent upfront tax relief (and further tax benefits down the line) for investing in early-stage companies. However, our survey shows that the numbers of FT readers planning on investing their bonuses into VCTs and EIS is the lowest since our survey began.\\n“I expect it will be a much quieter year for these more esoteric investments as higher earners now have more mainstream options,” adds Jason Hollands, managing director at Evelyn Partners. He also believes some of the pullback is due to risk aversion. “There’s still a potentially tough economic outlook for early-stage companies.”', metadata={'query': 'User response to added fees for household additions', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/466e8a11-f523-4f70-b299-6496a1aac77b', 'title': 'Pay out or doughnut?

These irritants are known as “dripped fees” or “junk fees”, but other names came to mind including “situational-monopolist fees”, “too-exhausted-to-resist fees” or, more simply, “chump charges”. The worst ones confuse customers and quell competition. What’s so complicated about getting rid of them?\\nThere are companies keen to stop thwacking their customers with extra charges at the checkout. But a solo move towards all-in pricing will make them seem expensive. The ticketing platform StubHub attempted as much in 2014, but reversed in 2015 after its market share shrank.

This week the UK government announced legislation that would ban hidden and unavoidable charges. In America the White House, regulators and state-level legislators are waging a wider war on junk fees they deem “unfair” or “deceptive”. The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a new cap on charges for people going overdrawn.\\nOne challenge is that the term “junk fee” is hard to pin down. The narrowest definition covers unavoidable fixed fees that are presented at the end of a purchase. A $2 booking fee shown at the checkout, for example. The broadest definition sprawls to include any charge that people don’t like, such as late payment, baggage handling or delivery fees. (I would argue that the American practice of adding taxes at the end of a transaction should qualify, but some legislators disagree.)\\nSuppose policymakers took a narrow definition of junk fees. Although regulations could work, companies have a habit of wriggling around new rules. Suppose, too, that the government banned hidden mandatory charges, but allowed companies to shroud add-ons. In a submission to the government, Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority noted retailers’ tendency to apply “charges that are theoretically optional, but which in practice are paid by the majority of their customers”.\\nRemoving all booking fees might look good, until you land on the final payment page to discover a doubled delivery fee. Not to worry though. You can always avoid the delivery charge altogether if you pick up your merchandise from the warehouse in Guangzhou, China.\\nA more expansive definition of junk fees could be a nightmare to enforce. And closing off every loophole might prove overwhelming. What counts as a legitimate unbundling of a service? And what if companies showed the all-in price at the start, but in a tiny font? Or what if you had to scroll down to see it? What if they included the booking fee on the first page, but not on the second?\\nWinning a game of whack-a-mole requires a lot of energy — and a big mallet. The Biden administration is keen to play. Its definition of junk fees seems broader than the British one, and includes late payment fees or overdraft charges, even if they are disclosed when people open bank accounts.\\nIt is possible that squashing fees like this will reduce overall payments by consumers, as seems to have happened in Britain when the Financial Conduct Authority limited unarranged overdraft charges. But Kristen Larson, a lawyer who advises credit unions, banks and fintechs on the regulatory environment, suggests that fees will simply rise somewhere else, redistributing between different types of customer. “Financial institutions aren’t non-profits,” she says.\\nAnother possible unintended consequence of curbing bank account fees is that banks withdraw credit from the people policymakers are trying to protect. An American law passed in 2009 limited credit card issuers from charging certain fees. Although some early evidence suggested no effect, a study published in 2022 found that banks responded by withdrawing credit from subprime borrowers.\\nThe most immediate risk when it comes to regulating junk fees in the US seems to be that over-enthusiasm to clamp down makes a mess. As more state legislatures join in, the chances rise of companies facing a patchwork of rules, only some of which cover, say, taxes or delivery fees.\\nIt is worth levelling the playing field for those businesses that decide they want to be upfront with their customers. If companies roll the fees into other charges, there might not be much of an effect on overall costs. But if shopping becomes much less annoying, I’m sold.\\nsoumaya.keynes@ft.com\\nBid for lunch with Soumaya Keynes and all proceeds go to the FT’s Financial Literacy and Inclusion Campaign charity\\nFollow Soumaya Keynes with myFT and on X', metadata={'query': 'User response to added fees for household additions', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/68f4226a-4157-41e6-95fe-8f92bce903cc', 'title': 'Why is it so hard to junk junk fees?', 'publication_time': '2024-01-26T05:00:39.337Z'}, uuid=UUID('d7a95f8a-4688-4620-ae47-0326313cbfb6'), db_id=''),\n",

Ofgem said the move was necessary to ensure suppliers were “resilient” and able to help customers who needed support.\\n“We know that cost of living pressure is hitting people hard and this is evident in the increase in energy debt reaching record levels,” said Tim Jarvis, director-general for markets at Ofgem. “However\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009we must take action to make sure suppliers can recover their reasonable costs, so the market remains resilient, and suppliers are offering consumers support in managing their debts.”\\nThe cost of electricity and gas has fallen since last winter when record wholesale energy prices triggered by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine pushed the price cap as high as £4,059, prompting the government to step in to support households.\\nBut the ending of those subsidies has left many households still struggling to pay their energy bills. Although wholesale gas and electricity prices have fallen they remain above pre-crisis levels. This is reflected in the energy price cap, which had dropped to £1,834 but is still much higher than pre-energy crisis levels when it was usually below £1,100.\\nThe proposed surcharge is designed to avoid a repeat of the market rout in late 2021 and early 2022 when 30 suppliers collapsed as wholesale energy prices surged and the price cap prevented them from passing on the extra costs to consumers.\\nAt the time, Ofgem allowed the remaining suppliers to recoup the cost of bailing out the millions of customers of those failed companies by adding £82 to each household bill.\\nGillian Cooper, director of energy at consumer group Citizens Advice, urged the government to do more to support struggling households. “Without action we’ll remain stuck in a cycle where rising levels of energy debt slowly pushes up the price cap and leads to higher bills for all,” she said.\\nLetter in response to this article:\\nOfgem’s nudge eco\\xadnom\\xadics / From Denis Mul\\xadhall, Lon\\xaddon KT3, UK', metadata={'query': 'User response to added fees for household additions', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1a3d88b1-666b-4be4-aefc-85f78bf84c61', 'title': 'British consumer energy debt hits record £3bn', 'publication_time': '2023-12-15T12:58:18.871Z'}, uuid=UUID('9121b4c1-f142-4084-bf1d-fa85ae146fe5'), db_id=''),\n",

It was 7.4 per cent for those who owned their property outright.\\nThe ONS said the bigger hit to mortgaged households was mainly because of high interest payments, which increased as the Bank of England raised the cost of borrowing to a 15-year high of 5.25 per cent over the past two years.\\nThe data was part of the first quarterly publication of the ONS household cost index, which is based on how much different types of households spend on goods and services.\\nThe headline inflation rate, by contrast, reflects price growth of goods and services consumed by all UK households.\\nAs a result, food and energy price growth, for example, have a greater impact on the experienced inflation of poorer households because they spend a bigger share of their income on essentials.\\nThe ONS HCI also includes the costs faced by households from changes in mortgage interest rates, stamp duty and other costs related to the purchase of a dwelling, which are not included in the headline inflation rate.\\nThe statistics agency therefore judges that the measure “most closely reflects households’ lived experience”.\\nIn addition to surpassing consumer price inflation in September, household cost inflation peaked at a rate of 12.6 per cent in October last year, compared with the 41-year high CPI of 11.1 per cent.\\nHowever, the agency said mortgagors also spent more than other groups on restaurants and hotels, where prices have increased quickly in recent months, contributing 1 percentage point to overall inflation for them.\\nBy contrast, renters spent more on electricity and other fuels. Annual price growth in that category has plunged on the back of a normalisation after the energy shock sparked by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\\nRental prices are rising at their fastest pace in at least seven years, contributing 1.6 percentage points to the annual inflation experienced by tenants.\\nRecommended\\nThe difference between renters and people with mortgages is likely to widen in the coming months after electricity and gas price growth turned negative in October, while more households were forced to remortgage at higher rates.\\nPaul Dales, economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said faster growth in the HCI for mortgagors was “exactly what you would expect and what the BoE would want to see after raising interest rates”.\\nHigher borrowing costs reduced demand in the economy by squeezing the real incomes of those with debts relative to those without, he added.\\nThe ONS data also showed that the large difference in inflation experienced by poorer and richer households throughout 2022 nearly disappeared in September 2023, reflecting diverging trends in energy and mortgage costs.\\nIn October 2022, annual inflation for low-income households peaked at 13.5 per cent, driven by high spending on energy.\\nIn the same period, high-income households were hit by a rate of 11.5 per cent, 2 percentage points less, the largest gap between the two groups in 13 years.\\nDr Sarah Cumbers, chief executive of the Royal Statistical Society, said the professional body had “long been campaigning for the development of the household cost indices as the best way to” represent the impact of inflation.\\n“We hope the government takes note of today’s figures which show that inflation is higher, and hitting those with a mortgage and social renters the hardest,” she added.\\nThe government said: “Inflation has halved, but we know some people are continuing to struggle, which is why we are committed to staying the course and getting it all way back down to 2 per cent.”\\nIt added that it was helping households “by providing £3,700 on average in cost of living support” and through its mortgage charter.', metadata={'query': 'User response to added fees for household additions', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/3d1b54dc-c0bf-4dd7-9c11-054eba3160c1', 'title': 'UK inflation highest for mortgaged households', 'publication_time': '2023-12-04T13:01:39.496Z'}, uuid=UUID('3f6df8a1-f7bd-4e4d-a397-9216a0ffe5cc'), db_id=''),\n",

You OK, hun?”\\nStuck up on London underground trains by Revolut in 2019, the damning question was the fintech’s tongue-in-cheek attempt to show off its close relationship with customers.\\nThe ad sparked a backlash, with many taking to social media to call out not only its patronising, “single-shaming” tone, but the fact that Revolut’s private bank transaction data could be so casually publicised.\\nThe PR disaster serves as a cautionary tale of the sensitivities around customer data in financial services, where trust and privacy are paramount to the client relationship.\\nBanks and payment companies have amassed a trove of data about clients’ financial behaviour, the rewards of which are too tempting to overlook.\\nFor banks and payments companies, the question is no longer whether they can leverage their data, but how and when they will seize this opportunity\\nWhile more conservative banks devote resources to “indirectly monetise” their customers’ information by offering them better-suited offers and products, the boldest disrupters —\\xa0fintechs such as Revolut and PayPal — are experimenting with selling anonymised data to advertisers, while Klarna and the US bank Chase sell targeted ad space on their platforms.\\nAndreas Schwabe, managing director at consultants Alvarez & Marsal, describes the sector as being at a “critical juncture” with regards to its use of customer data, either for internal or external purposes.\\n“For banks and payments companies, the question is no longer whether they can leverage their data, but how and when they will seize this opportunity — and who will emerge as the frontrunner in this rapidly evolving landscape,” he says.\\nSo what exactly do banks and payment providers plan to do with your financial data? Is it safe? And is there anything you can do about it?\\nThe value of our financial data has been recognised for decades . “Information about money has become almost as important as money itself,” observed former Citibank chief executive Walter Wriston in 1984. Though his efforts to position the lender as a competitor to data companies such as Bloomberg largely failed, the adage is truer now than ever.\\nAs the use of cash falls, more of our lives are recorded in the form of electronic payments. From friend and business networks to spending on everything from luxury handbags to charitable donations to gambling and pornography sites, much can be revealed about a person from their bank account and transaction history.\\nThe use of personal data is regulated differently across Europe and the US. UK legislation splits data into two categories. Sensitive, or “special category”, data includes information about racial or ethnic origin, genetics, religion, trade union membership, biometrics, health and sexual orientation. The rest is classified as non-sensitive data, which is easier for companies to handle.\\nTransaction data is not inherently sensitive, but protected characteristics can be gleaned through analysis and enrichment — the process of improving the value of existing data by adding new or missing information.\\nKarla Prudencio Ruiz, an advocacy officer at the research non-profit group Privacy International, gives the example of a banking customer who pays school fees at a faith school, suggesting their religion; or someone spending regularly at the oncology unit at a hospital, providing information about their health. “You can deduce things,” she says.\\nRecommended\\nSome fintech executives have stated that a more integrated use of customer data could shift their business model. Undeterred by its Valentine’s Day mishap, Revolut is in talks to sell advertising space on its app to brands. Antoine Le Nel, its head of growth, told the FT in April that the fintech could become a true media and advertising business in the future.\\nIn order to sell this to advertisers, the company, which received a UK banking licence over the summer, is looking to increase the time its customers spend browsing its financial app. Like social media companies, it keeps a close eye on its customer “engagement” metric.\\nChad West, a former employee of Revolut who led its Valentine’s Day campaign, describes the ad as an “error”.\\n“Regardless on whether the data was aggregated or fake, it gave the impression that finance firms snoop on your every move and transaction, which is not the case.”\\nBut, he adds, the fintech’s current plan to advertise from within its banking app carries the risk of annoying customers and tarnishing its reputation for a great user experience.\\n“It’s crucial that they perform solid due diligence on what the short-term impact could be, such as an exodus of privacy conscious customers, versus the long-term impact, such as a loss of trust in the event of a data leak or poor privacy controls.”\\nZilch, another UK fintech, has built its business model on this premise. The company, which is backed by eBay and Goldman Sachs and has about 4mn customers, makes money from targeted advertising based on its transaction data which it uses to subsidise the cost of credit for consumers with zero-interest loans.\\n“We’re actually an ad platform that’s built a credit proposition on top of it,” chief executive Philip Belamant told the FT in June.\\nFor all the enthusiasm, the nascent offerings are yet to prove a game-changer for banks. For Tom Merry, head of banking strategy at Accenture, a consulting firm, their benefits can be overplayed while the challenges are not necessarily worth the potential rewards.\\n“Banks are sat on tonnes of what I would call ‘nearly useful data’,” he says, referring to “large volumes of aggregated anonymised socio-economic cohort and transaction data” that can become more valuable through enrichment.\\n“Sometimes people over-emphasise the value of that nearly useful data,” he continues. Banks have it, but also retailers and third party databases as well as loyalty scheme providers. “People can get it from elsewhere, probably as deeply and without having to go into the complex web of integrating with banks.”\\nMerry says that making substantial money from monetising data would require “scale” and “a sufficiently differentiated set of insights that people would pay a higher margin for it”. Otherwise, he says, “it’s probably not going to change the profile of a bank’s business model”.\\nLloyds Banking Group sees the monetisation of its 26mn customers’ financial data as an area of growth. The retail bank launched a “customer insights” team in 2022 that has grown to 40 employees.\\nLucy Stoddart, managing director of Lloyds’ global transaction solutions, said one example of this was analysing aggregated and anonymised customer data around shopping habits to provide insights to commercial real estate landlords and help them make better-informed strategic decisions.\\nThe potential for data breaches risks damaging the trust between customers and the institutions holding and managing their money.\\nA report by consultancy Thinks Insights and Strategy found that people perceive sharing their credit and debit transactions as more risky than other types of data, including health information, because the benefits of doing so are less clear.\\nYoung people aged between 18 and 24 years tend to worry about data sharing less than their older peers. However, that may be because they have been sharing it their whole lives, according to the Office for National Statistics.\\nDonna Sharp, a managing director at MediaLink, which helps companies including in financial services to run media campaigns, says analysing customer data is an essential part of the service that banks and payment companies provide.\\n“The reality is that all these financial institutions have your data; you want them to [have it]. It protects you,” says Sharp. She gives the example of banks figuring out whether a card was stolen via behavioural pattern analysis and geolocation data.\\n[As] more data flows, what you end up with over time\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009is much more personal pricing: you get the right price for you based on your credit risk\\nThe challenge, she says, is fostering greater “transparency and understanding of how that might be used and what’s the value to you.” She believes consumers are generally fine with their data being used as long as they can see the benefits trickle down to them.\\n“If [I’m getting] 10 per cent off a trip\\xa0I want to go on, I’m not mad that you brought that information to me,” says Sharp.\\nIn the UK, the open banking industry, which allows financial companies to access to non-anonymised bank data with the permission of customers, was built on the promise that sharing data in this way would foster greater competition and ultimately benefit customers.\\nJustin Basini, chief executive of credit report company ClearScore, says\\u2009data-sharing technology can allow lenders to access information previously only accessible by banks, known as “current account turnover”, in addition to credit reports and scoring. Seeing a fuller picture of prospective borrowers’ financial health allows lenders to adjust their rates and extend credit to more people.\\n“[As] more data flows, what you end up with over time\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009is much more personal pricing: you get the right price for you based on your credit risk, and you’re not bucketed with other people,” says Basini.\\n“If the market is basically more able to discriminate risk because there’s more data around, everybody gets a fairer price.”\\nClearScore also gives “credit health” scores by using open banking to analyse transaction data to show customers how specific payments such as gambling may affect their options with lenders. Under open banking legislation, ClearScore requires explicit permission from consumers, which has to be renewed every 12 weeks through various loops including ID checks.\\nStopping your financial data from being used by your bank or payment provider is tricky. In the UK, any company handling customer data has to comply with a variety of rules. For instance, they need opt-in consent from customers and a legitimate reason to use their data. Claire Edwards, data protection partner at law firm Addleshaw Goddard, says another important principle they need to stick to is “data minimisation” — not collecting more information than is needed.\\nBut this only applies to data that identifies people.\\n“Once it’s anonymised, it falls outside our regime. The banks are probably already doing whatever they want with that,” she says. “As a consumer you can’t really opt out of that.”\\nUnder UK privacy law, individuals can send “data subject access requests” (DSARs) to ask companies if they are using and storing their personal data, and request copies of this information. Companies have 30 days to respond under the Data Protection Act.\\nOne high-profile case saw politician Nigel Farage send such a request to private bank Coutts after it closed his account . The bank was then obliged to send him a dossier that revealed its reputational risk committee had accused him of “pandering to racists” and being a “disingenuous grifter”.\\nCustomers dissatisfied with DSARs can also complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office, the UK’s privacy watchdog. Such claims have jumped 15 per cent in the year to the end of April, a freedom of information request sent by consultancy KPMG found. Complaints about financial companies’ responses to DSARs made up the largest share of the total, ahead of the health sector.\\nThis could be because financial companies — and particularly banks built on a patchwork of IT systems — may struggle to source data quickly and present it in a readable way. They also have to leave out information that may breach anti-financial crime regulations. Bank employees are criminally liable for “tipping off” — disclosing information that could prejudice an ongoing or potential law enforcement investigation into a customer’s activities.\\nPrivacy International is campaigning against the UK’s data protection and digital information bill , which would give the government powers to monitor bank accounts to detect red flags for fraud and error in the welfare system.\\nThe campaign group raised alarm around the “extraordinary” scope of these powers. It says they will set a “deeply concerning precedent for generalised, intrusive financial surveillance in the UK” by allowing financial companies to trawl through customer accounts without prior suspicion of fraud.\\nThe group says it is particularly disproportionate that the powers will allow surveillance of state benefit recipients, as well as linked accounts such as those of partners, parents and landlords.\\n“This wide scope of data collection could create a detailed and intrusive view of the private lives of those affected,” Privacy International said in a letter to former work and pensions secretary Mel Stride.\\nWhen it comes to banks analysing their own customer data, advocacy officer Prudencio Ruiz says consent from customers must be “informed” in order to be valid and that they should understand which information might be used, how and to what end. But they also need to be presented with a real alternative.\\n“You need to be able to say OK, I don’t want to. What’s my option? And if the option is you won’t get the service, then that’s not consent.”\\nThis article has been amended since publication to clarify that moves by fintechs to\\xa0monetise their customer data include experiments with selling anonymised data or space on their apps to advertisers', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/754e598e-e96d-4a32-b4d2-a949f762b537', 'title': 'What are banks doing with your financial data?', 'publication_time': '2024-11-22T05:00:31.627Z'}, uuid=UUID('6d8dadd9-866b-4189-a35c-44cb985837a1'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nJohn Thornhill\\nA quarter of a century ago, Scott McNealy, then chief executive of Sun Microsystems, famously dismissed consumer privacy in the internet age as an anachronistic distraction. “You have zero privacy anyway,” he said. “Get over it.” Judging by the way in which consumers have since posted details of their private lives all over social media and breezily ticked the intrusive terms and conditions boxes of many online companies, McNealy may have had a point.\\nBut how we act and what we think can be two different things. Internet users do not appear to have “got over it” when it comes to privacy. Indeed, consumers are now telling pollsters that they increasingly worry about the misuse of their personal data and want stricter controls. A Pew Research poll in the US last year found that 81 per cent of respondents were concerned about how companies collected their data; 71 per cent expressed similar concerns about the government (compared with 64 per cent in 2019).\\nSuch anxieties are all the more acute when it comes to highly sensitive personal information, such as genetic data, which not only affects one individual but all their relatives, too. When you spit into a tube and send it off for DNA testing, you are handing over unique data that cannot be anonymised. You are also sharing information about all your biological family, most likely without their consent. That makes it all the more critical that such data is secure.\\nIn some cases, there are glaring concerns about who can access — or sell — that data. Several users of the London-based DNA testing company Atlas Biomed have recently expressed alarm about the security of their personal information. The business appears to be inactive — it is late filing its annual accounts and has not been active online. It reportedly did not respond to recent enquiries from the BBC and there has been speculation about its links with Russian business interests.\\nThe Information Commissioner’s Office, which enforces Britain’s data privacy laws, also confirmed that\\xa0it received a complaint about the company.\\nIn the US, customers of the 23andMe DNA-testing service are also anxiously following the fate of the company, which this week admitted there was “substantial doubt” over its survival without the injection of fresh funds. Some 15mn people have used the service and around 80 per cent of them have agreed to share their data for scientific research.\\nAnne Wojcicki, 23andMe’s co-founder and chief executive, has said she intends to take the company private and will not consider a third-party takeover. “We are committed to protecting customer data and are consistently focused on maintaining the privacy of our customers. That will not change,” the company said in a statement to the FT.\\nBut users are unlikely to be reassured. 23andMe’s genetic data is not covered by the US federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which applies to most medical data. It also suffered a serious data breach last year in which 6.9mn user accounts were compromised. Wojcicki has fallen out with the rest of the board, who have resigned en masse. And it is not clear what would happen to 23andMe’s data if the company went bust.\\n“23andMe highlights very valid anxieties and fears people feel when they have given highly sensitive information to a company for a specific purpose,” says Sara Geoghegan, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington DC. “Users deserve more than a pinky promise that their privacy wishes will be respected.” For more than 20 years, Epic has been campaigning for a federal privacy law that would protect users’ rights.\\nSuch legislation seems unlikely given the anti-regulation stance of the incoming Trump administration — even if many Republicans are themselves concerned about data privacy. The only real alternative is for consumers to assert their power by wresting more control. They must press tech companies to minimise the data they collect, become more transparent about its use and ensure that user consent is voluntary and informed. “Even with the best possible laws, it will not be possible to stop criminals or foreign governments hacking into your data,” says Carissa Véliz, author of Privacy is Power . “Tech solutions are very important.”\\nSome digital services already offer privacy by design but there is currently little market incentive for their expansion. Users should contest McNealy’s fatalism and stimulate that consumer demand.\\njohn.thornhill@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/206fafe2-aa6c-443c-ada0-4abb8af96860', 'title': 'Genetic data is worth more than warm spit', 'publication_time': '2024-11-14T15:47:13.355Z'}, uuid=UUID('7c2bcc45-23ca-4b39-9f3c-f9a117429d84'), db_id=''),\n",

Since the law was passed third-party apps that are linked to an individual’s bank account have proliferated, without clear rules on how information should be best shared.\\nThe information can be shared through an API (application-programming interface) that allows two websites to easily communicate with each other. But “screen scraping” — where consumers share their bank log-in details for bots to copy their financial information, a practice that regulators have taken a dim view of — is also still used in the US.\\nThe CFPB’s rules will compel banks to put in place systems that will facilitate consumer access to their financial data such as transaction history, account balances and payments details. The CFPB said it was requiring this data be made available for free, and that it hoped these rules would deter the use of screen scraping.\\nThe issue of whether banks could charge a fee to third parties for data sharing had been an area of contention. Banking lobbyists had argued that banks should have the option to charge a fee given the costs of building systems to facilitate the data sharing.\\nRecommended\\nOne aim for the rules is to make it easier for customers to use third-party apps and also stimulate more competition among banks. The US has about 4,000 banks, which range from behemoths such as JPMorgan Chase with more than $2tn in deposits to local lenders with tens of millions of dollars in deposits.\\nBanks with more than $850mn in assets and fintech companies will be subject to these new data sharing rules.\\nAdvocates for open banking also argue that it could pave the way for greater adoption of direct account payments in the US, known as pay by bank , as a viable alternative to credit and debit cards that typically charge higher fees.', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/fcd6e70f-60e3-40c2-876b-e4a8a90084c2', 'title': 'US rolls out ‘open banking’ rules to make sharing financial data easier', 'publication_time': '2024-10-22T22:54:34.096Z'}, uuid=UUID('cdc57074-6634-4dc1-adba-acd865975fff'), db_id=''),\n",

So it is unlikely many of them noticed a new rule on Tuesday making it easier to move personal data from one financial company to another — an innovation known as “open banking”. Banks and their lobbyists, though, care deeply.\\nThe idea, which Britain introduced seven years ago, is that lenders must share data with rivals when a customer requests it. This initiative from the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is broadly helpful. Switching banks would become easier. Those with sparse credit records could invoke their transaction history to help get a loan.\\nYet open banking is already turning into open warfare. The Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group, says the CFPB has overstepped its authority . JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US lender, describes the CFPB’s approach as “unconscionable”. The Bank Policy Institute filed a lawsuit challenging the rule within hours of its publication.\\nIt does not help that CFPB head Rohit Chopra is pitching the initiative as a way for dissatisfied consumers to “fire” their banks. But opponents are right that there are wrinkles to be ironed out, such as exactly how the technology will work, and how millions of data transfers will be policed effectively. Lenders are also bristling at the CFPB’s refusal to let them charge fees to offset the cost of complying.\\nIn Britain, open banking, marketed as a boost to competition, brought less teeth-gnashing. But then the US is a different beast. It has more than 4,000 banks, but four — JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup — tower over the rest. JPMorgan’s assets are 3,500 times bigger than the median lender’s, according to Federal Reserve data .\\nIntroduce more market forces, and odd things could happen. Customers might switch from big banks to smaller ones with better rates. They might defect from smaller banks to bigger ones with slicker services. Or they might do nothing. The average customer has been with their bank for 17 years, one survey found.\\nBanks have much to lose if customers get friskier. For example, US institutions collectively have about $4tn in non-interest bearing deposits. Imagine those earned just 1 per cent in interest — a quarter of what banks earn lending to each other overnight — and it would cost lenders $40bn, about a tenth of the industry’s total pre-tax profit, based on data collected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\\nThe furious reaction of banks belies the more likely outcome, resembling what happened in Britain: some service improvements, but no drastic changes in market share. Resorting to the courts suggests banks are not taking any chances. If they get their way, the door to open banking may get unceremoniously slammed shut.\\njohn.foley@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/0197a3af-89ae-49b6-9dd4-55e3e5592fa9', 'title': 'Open banking challenges America’s cozy lenders’ club', 'publication_time': '2024-10-23T09:37:40.012Z'}, uuid=UUID('30ec6086-fc6a-482e-93de-3974960eee87'), db_id=''),\n",

Plus, over in AI, a new virtual agent could run your life for you.\\nCristina Criddle It can schedule calendar appointments for you. These kind of tedious things that take us quite a long time to do.\\nSonja Hutson I’m Sonja Hutson, and here’s the news you need to start your day.\\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\\nBoeing workers voted to reject a deal with the company yesterday. That means the nearly six-week strike will continue.\\xa0The deal would have increased pay by 35 per cent over four years and improved retirement benefits. But workers wanted a 40 per cent raise and for the company to restore a defined benefit pension plan they previously lost.\\xa0It’s a blow to Boeing’s new CEO and his plan to stabilize the business.\\xa0The company reported a $6bn loss last quarter and said it would continue to bleed cash.\\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\\nThe US has announced new rules that will make sharing bank information a little bit simpler. They’re called open banking regulations and they’ll help customers connect their accounts to apps like Venmo or PayPal. But big banks are not a fan. Here to tell us more is the FT’s Josh Franklin. Hey, Josh!\\nJoshua Franklin Hi there.\\nSonja Hutson OK, so give me the rundown on these new rules. What are we talking about here?\\nJoshua Franklin So these are kind of clear guidelines. Rules of the road for how banks should allow their customers to connect and share their data with third-party apps. So things like Venmo and PayPal. And also facilitate consumers having access to kind of share their financial history — things like transaction histories, account balances and payment details. With the hope that if it’s easier to do that, it’ll make it easier for you to switch banks if you’re not happy with the service you’re getting at the bank you have right now.\\nSonja Hutson So these new regulations would help me easily transfer data from my old bank to my new bank. And they’d also make it easier to use apps like Venmo. But I guess I’m wondering — I mean, I’ve been using Venmo for years — why is this all happening now?\\nJoshua Franklin Yeah, these rules have been almost 10 years in the making. They’ve come out of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the US, the CFPB. And that’s an agency that’s gone through a little bit of ups and downs over the last kind of eight years with the change of presidential administration. And these rules have just been hard to iron out and figure out. And so in the meantime, this practice has still been going on. So you’ve got kind of sometimes best practices being used or what’s seen as being good practices. And other times the practices are a little bit more questionable. And this is particularly true in the case of what’s known in the US as screen scraping, where you’ll share your login details for a third party to use your account details. They’ll basically just copy and paste the financial information that they need. And that’s seen as not being terribly secure and a safe way to do it. So now what these current rules are doing is just kind of establishing a clearer and hopefully more secure way of doing that.\\nSonja Hutson And Josh, how do the banks themselves feel about these regulations?\\nJoshua Franklin They have taken issue with the rules. So much so that they’ve actually taken the unusual step of suing the CFPB to try to block them from happening. They claim that this actually risks endangering customer data by making data more accessible for third-party apps that maybe the banks would argue don’t have terribly strict security controls.\\nYou know, and I think there’s definitely an element of the banks kind of talking up their own book here. Given that there is some anxiety that by introducing more competition — which is the goal of the CFPB rule — it makes it harder for banks to hold on to clients and also opens the door more to threat from potential newer companies that are offering kind of financial technology products to clients.\\nSonja Hutson What have analysts told you about where this lawsuit from banks could be going? I mean, is there a chance it could actually overturn the CFPB rule?\\nJoshua Franklin It’s still very early days but there’s definitely a feeling among some analysts who have taken a close look at this that the banks might actually have a strong case. And you know, potentially the door could close on open banking just as quickly as it opened.\\nSonja Hutson Josh Franklin is the FT’s US banking editor. Thanks, Josh.\\nJoshua Franklin Thanks very much.\\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\\nSonja Hutson Deutsche Bank delivered some mixed news in its earnings report yesterday. The German lender saw record profits last quarter. That’s thanks to revenues from its trading and investment advisory businesses. But it also warned investors to brace for higher-than-expected loan losses next quarter. Deutsche Bank blamed that on the commercial real estate crisis and some, quote, larger corporate defaults. Its chief financial officer did say those issues should disappear next year, though.\\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\\nKeeping up with day-to-day tasks can be a bit of a time suck. But it’s a fact of life, right? Well, not according to AI start-up Anthropic. On Tuesday, it unveiled a new computer use feature for its model, Claude. It says this tool will enable Claude to basically act like a personal assistant and control your computer. The FT’s Cristina Criddle has been following this new era of virtual agents. She joins me now. Hi, Cristina.\\nCristina Criddle Hi.\\nSonja Hutson So can you walk me through how this computer use feature works, exactly?\\nCristina Criddle So most tasks that you can do on your computer, Claude can do for you. And that includes like quite mundane tasks like filing expenses or booking travel. So you would put an instruction into Claude — much like you would if you were interacting with the chatbot interface — and ask it to do a task for you. But the types of tasks it can do now are controlling your mouse and keyboard. So it can browse the internet and do research. It can schedule calendar appointments for you. It can fill in forms and it can transfer data from one document to another. These kind of tedious things that take us quite a long time to do, but wouldn’t take your computer that long to do if you instructed it in the right way.\\nSonja Hutson Got it. And how unusual is Claude’s new feature? I mean, I’m assuming other AI companies are working on something similar.\\nCristina Criddle This is the first time I’ve seen a feature like this. It is quite unusual and I would say a big step. It feels at the moment like every tech company is announcing their version of AI agents, though. Microsoft announced some recent autonomous agents in its 365 product suite and then OpenAI recently launched developer access to some of its voice models.\\nSo one example demoed by OpenAI was where you would ask the chatbot to find you locations that would sell strawberries near you. And then you could select the business and ask the chatbot to order you a certain amount of strawberries for a certain price. And it would call this business and put in the order for you using its voice. And so this is kind of the next frontier. Many of the AI companies are calling it for this technology, but we’ve yet to see widespread development and implementation into our lives yet.\\nSonja Hutson OK. So admittedly, I will say having a bot do this admin that I usually really dislike doing, it does sound really great. But I’m also wondering what are the risks of letting a robot program your life, basically? I mean, Claude messing up a flight booking, for example, feels a lot riskier than a chatbot just spurting out nonsense.\\nCristina Criddle It can make mistakes and even that was one of the things that was highlighted by Anthropic when they were demoing this feature, was that it might still click on a website in its search that isn’t that reliable. So it is in its early stages. The company warned that and they say it’s kind of like self-driving cars at the moment where consumers don’t really trust it to drive on its own. And it’s very much still got to have your hands on the wheel making sure that those kind of mistakes aren’t happening or if they do happen, you’re able to step in.\\nSonja Hutson And Cristina, I feel like we can’t ignore how very human-like this all sounds. I mean, it seems like we’re racing ahead really quickly with AI developments. Is anyone concerned about these agents getting too powerful?\\nCristina Criddle It is human-like. But we have interacted with technology to make these experiences easier for us already. I think there is a wider concern about if these models reach artificial general intelligence — which is intelligence at the same level as most humans — and that’s what a lot of these companies hope to achieve. If that happens, then maybe there’s cause for concern because the level of control that you have over those systems is still unclear and those safeguards haven’t been put in place yet.\\nSonja Hutson Cristina Criddle is the FT’s technology correspondent.

The move follows a pilot with NatWest and Metro Bank that the tech group said had helped it close 20,000 accounts after banks shared links of malicious websites where fraudulent transactions took place.\\nThe expansion comes as the tech sector falls under greater scrutiny for its role in enabling authorised push payment (APP) fraud, in which victims are tricked into sending money to fraudsters from their bank accounts.\\nBritons lost £460mn to APP fraud last year, according to trade body UK Finance, 70 per cent of which involved goods that were ordered online by consumers but did not arrive.\\nMost purchase fraud comes from false adverts on social media platforms including Facebook Marketplace and Instagram, according to Lloyds Banking Group and TSB.\\nNathaniel Gleicher, global head of counter-fraud at Meta, said the company “would love more banks to partner with us” but cautioned that he could not quantify the impact the initiative would have on fraud. “I don’t think any one approach is a silver bullet to drive down fraud by itself,” he said.\\nRocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at consumer group Which?, welcomed the partnership but said “much greater collaboration between key businesses and government” was needed.\\n“New duties, equivalent to the obligations being introduced for banks and online platforms, should be placed on telecom providers, online advertising providers and domain registrars to ensure they verify the legitimacy of users,” he said.\\nBanks and politicians have criticised the tech sector’s efforts to prevent fraud. Labour said in the run-up to the election that tech companies “contribute very little” to tackling online fraud or compensating victims, according to a party document seen by the Financial Times .\\nMeta is a signatory to the online fraud charter, a voluntary agreement drawn up last year between tech companies and the government to reduce fraud.\\nSocial media companies are also obliged to take down fraudulent ads under the Online Safety Act, with media regulator Ofcom empowered to issue fines against companies that fail to do so. Despite the tech sector’s initiatives to combat fraud, cases of APP fraud rose 12 per cent in 2023 to about 230,000, fuelled by a 36 per cent increase in purchase scams, according to UK Finance.\\nUnder new rules set to take effect on October 7, banks and payment companies will be liable to reimburse victims of fraud for claims worth up to £85,000 .\\nThe financial sector argues that making tech companies share some of the cost with banks would give the platforms a bigger incentive to tackle the problem at its roots.\\nRecommended\\nGleicher said there had been cases where “bad actors actually abuse those recompense schemes to commit more frauds” and that Meta already had incentives to fight fraud, including avoiding potential fines from Ofcom.\\n“The first [incentive] is that our users don’t like getting targeted by fraud. If you want to create a community that people participate in, you want them to be safe in that community,” he said.\\nIn response to Labour’s draft plans to make tech companies contribute to fraud compensation payouts made by banks, Gleicher said:\\xa0“Our biggest focus is doing everything that we can voluntarily and through regulatory engagement to counter these scams to stop them in the first place.”\\nMark Tierney, chief executive of Stop Scams UK, said the cross-industry coalition was “delighted to see some of our member banks join Meta’s FIRE initiative”, adding that it “could become a game-changer for reporting fraudulent content”.', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/ff5ed0ed-170d-4439-a789-d658936fd5f5', 'title': 'Meta expands data accord with UK banks in push to cut online fraud', 'publication_time': '2024-10-02T08:00:20.027Z'}, uuid=UUID('6b03b3c7-2e2e-4523-92e4-f3d8f2957cca'), db_id=''),\n",

The products are popular because holdings can be tailored to minimise income tax and to express the owner’s values, such as a preference for using environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors to invest.\\nThe deal is part of BNY chief executive Robin Vince’s efforts to modernise the public profile of the US’s oldest bank. Known for its custodian services, BNY is trying to sell itself as a platform providing a range of services to financial customers.\\nThe separately managed accounts market is highly concentrated with a few large providers; BNY said it hopes to win business from new entrants and from asset managers looking for expert help. Archer, which was founded in 2000, is the largest outsourcing provider in the market, servicing about $600bn in assets, or more than 10 per cent.\\n“It is a market that all of our asset management clients have been expanding in\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009and Archer has cracked the code,” said Emily Portney, BNY’s global head of asset servicing. “It underscores\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009that we are a solutions business.”\\nBNY did not give a price for the Archer deal, which is expected to close later this year once it receives regulatory approvals.\\nArcher’s technology supports 400,000 different investment portfolios for brokers and investment advisers. The software allows customers to follow model portfolios and make adjustments based on their client’s personal preferences. The accounts are often used to offer tax loss harvesting, which lower income tax bills by selling some assets at a loss to balance other gains, and direct indexing, which replicates an index through individual securities holdings.\\nBNY is already a client of Archer. The privately owned group has averaged a 20 per cent annual growth rate for the past five years, said chief executive Bryan Dori, who, with his top executives, will be staying on after the deal closes later this year. The 185 employees of Archer will participate in BNY’s internal stock ownership programme, which began offering BNY shares to all employees in 2023.\\nThe three biggest separately managed account providers are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (through its Parametric subsidiary) and JPMorgan Chase.

       "  (Document(text='\\nOlaf Storbeck in Neckarsulm\\nSelling bread, butter and other staples at cut-throat prices has made Dieter Schwarz one of Europe’s richest men.\\nNow the 84-year-old founder of discount retailer Lidl , who according to business magazine Manager Magazin has amassed €40bn in personal wealth, is branching out into a very different staple of the modern world: data services.\\nStarting with a system built for internal use in 2021, Lidl owner Schwarz Group now offers cloud computing and cyber security services to corporate customers.\\nIts IT unit, Schwarz Digits — which became a standalone operating division in 2023 — has signed up clients including Germany’s biggest software group SAP, the country’s most successful football club Bayern Munich and the port of Hamburg. Last year, the unit generated €1.9bn in annual sales and it employs 7,500 staff.\\n“We did not start with a commercial motivation in mind but just wanted to address our own needs,” Christian Müller, co-chief executive of Schwarz Digits told the Financial Times in a rare interview. “We’re on a very steep growth path.”\\nA main selling point of its service is that all client data is processed and stored exclusively in Germany and Austria, which have stringent privacy and data protection laws.\\nWhen Schwarz, a privately held business with €167.2bn in annual sales, was first exploring new options for storing data, it “did not want to be dependent on third parties,” Müller said.\\nAnd if there was no German option, it wanted at least to use a European provider and avoid storing data in other jurisdictions. After concluding that no existing provider could meet its needs, the company decided to set up its own cloud service.\\n“We have loads of highly sensitive data,” said Müller, such as sales patterns for individual stores, pricing calculations, customer information from Lidl’s loyalty programme and details of the group’s 575,000 employees.\\nWhen Lidl had its own cloud up and running, it soon discovered that other German businesses were asking themselves the same questions about whether they wanted to use the biggest cloud services based in the US and China.\\n“It is extremely important that Europe is on top of state-of-the art information technology and able to provide such services,” said Johannes Helbig, professor for digital sovereignty at Erlangen-Nürnberg University, adding that Schwarz Group’s approach was “important and much welcome” and “a highly encouraging role model”.\\nA precondition for an interview at Schwarz Group’s IT control centre in its sprawling headquarters was not to disclose its precise location on the estate. The group worries about the security of the nerve centre that is vital to the running of its 14,000 Lidl and Kaufland stores globally, as well as 220 warehouses and a growing number of factories that churn out products including bottled water, pasta and ice cream.\\nBefore entering the premises, visitors must leave their mobile phones and all other electronic devices in a locker outside, and access is controlled by staff on a desk, as well as an automatic door controlled by a palm vein scanner.\\nThe business is notoriously publicity-shy and only a few years ago started to hire media relations staff. It is based in the outskirts of Neckarsulm, a small town of 27,000 in Germany’s wealthy south-west, and has slowly opened up in recent years. It now sponsors the Lidl-Trek Tour de France cycling team and was a high-profile partner of the Euro 2024 football tournament, with the children who walked the players to the start wearing Lidl-branded kit.\\nLast year, Schwarz decided to dip its toe in artificial intelligence, acquiring a minority stake in German AI start-up Aleph Alpha.\\nDieter Schwarz is taking this opportunity to pursue broader goals in the fast-developing technology: his charitable foundation is working with the company’s home state of Baden-Württemberg to fund an AI campus in the city of Heilbronn. The campus aims to become “the global home” of applied AI and is partnering with Aleph Alpha.\\nSchwarz Digits’ focus on cloud computing, cyber security and AI was “well thought through”, said Axel Oppermann, owner of German IT consultancy Avispador, because all three areas were “highly relevant for clients”. The size and financial power of its owner made Schwarz Digits more attractive to external clients who “are looking for an IT partner who won’t be gone within two years,” he added.\\nWhile Schwarz Digits had become “a credible regional challenger” to large incumbents such as Amazon Web Services, Google and Microsoft, Oppermann said the firm was at competitive disadvantage because it lacked their wide networks of external service partners, which market cloud products and help with the implementation and management of services. Amazon Web Services, for example, has a network of 130,000 partners in 200 countries.\\nBut for regional companies with a close eye on data privacy and control, Schwarz Digits is an attractive option. “The key reason for us [to use Schwarz] was the offer’s digital sovereignty,” Bayern Munich told the FT, adding that Schwarz Digits’ focus on data protection and privacy stood out. “There is no comparable product available on the market,” the club said.\\nIts cyber security products have also convinced software juggernaut SAP, which became a client in 2023. The Schwarz cyber security platform “is showing us our IT systems from the perspective of a potential attacker,” SAP told the FT, adding that this was useful for identifying weak spots and analysing potential threats.\\nSchwarz built up this expertise in 2021 when it bought Israeli cyber security company XM Cyber for $700mn. Initially it had wanted only to become a client of the firm, which was co-founded by a former boss of Israel’s secret service Mossad.\\nRecommended\\n“We evaluated every available cyber security product and concluded that XM Cyber’s was the best by far,” said Rolf Schumann, Schwarz Digits’ other co-chief executive. But the group then discovered XM Cyber was considering a stock market listing and worried that this could lead to the departure of key staff. “Hence we decided to add the whole company to our group.”\\nSchwarz’s investment in AI was “the next logical step” in broadening its tech expertise, said Müller. When Aleph Alpha raised more than €100mn in fresh equity last year, Schwarz Digits took part in the funding round, which also included research grants and business commitments worth close to €400mn.\\nBut just as caution about security and privacy has shaped Schwarz’s approach to cloud computing, its use of external AI is being guided by similar principles.\\nWhile the company views it as a crucial emerging technology, it is wary about internal data being used with AI tools that are outside its control. “We did not want to run into this trap,” said Müller. Hence it decided to block access to ChatGPT for staff “on day one” when the chatbot was launched.', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/08eb1b45-91c2-4312-9d3c-ac5e4e557278', 'title': 'How Lidl accidentally took on the big guns of cloud computing', 'publication_time': '2024-08-23T04:00:17.683Z'}, uuid=UUID('ca3d77cc-93b5-4623-9099-40955b175f3a'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nEleanor Olcott and Wenjie Ding in Beijing\\nChina’s powerful data watchdog has proposed tighter controls over users’ online information, including a nationwide rollout of digital IDs, in a move that met sharp pushback from leading technology experts.\\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China, alongside the country’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS), released draft regulations to issue unified digital IDs for internet users on Friday last week. Concern about the idea has increased over the past few days.\\nThe IDs, which would be jointly administered by the CAC and police, are initially envisaged as voluntary and would be used in place of real names and phone numbers to register on internet platforms.\\nBut the proposal could drastically extend authorities’ oversight over online behaviour, potentially covering everything from internet shopping history to travel itineraries.\\nTom Nunlist, associate director at China-focused consultancy Trivium, said the proposals could “significantly expand the government’s ability to monitor people’s activity online. It would give the police much greater insight into what people are doing online.”\\nUnder existing rules, internet users in China must use their personal ID or phone number to register on platforms such as WeChat and microblogging site Weibo. This allows platforms and authorities to police online activity, such as combating cyberbullying and misinformation, as well as to censor critical discussion of the government.\\nNunlist said relying on personal IDs had empowered platform companies to gather user data that could be used for their financial gain. Replacing personal IDs with anonymous digital ones would allow the state to monitor online activity while limiting companies’ ability to track consumer behaviour.\\nIn recent years, Beijing has cracked down on what it has called abusive practices by internet companies to collect consumer data, issuing fines and introducing new laws governing data regulation.\\nBut some legal scholars questioned the regulators’ motivations in weakening platforms’ access to user data. Lao Dongyan, a criminal law professor at Tsinghua University, wrote on Weibo that the “claim of protecting personal information is a facade” and that the “real intention” of the draft regulations was to “regulate people’s online behaviour”.\\nShe said the proposed system would be akin to “installing a monitor for everyone’s online behaviour, with all online traces such as one’s internet search history easily collected”.\\nSome experts also questioned whether the government was better placed than companies to manage sensitive data. Yu Jianrong, a retired professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote on Weibo that the draft rules raised “social risks”, including the threat of criminals accessing a unified database of individual users’ internet behaviour.\\nChinese internet users’ faith in the government to safely store data was severely tested in 2022 after hackers seized a huge trove of personal information from the Shanghai police, which cyber security experts at the time found had been left online and unsecured for months.\\nYu also questioned the legal basis for the change, citing a “lack of authority” for the application of online IDs. Lao also said the proposed rules “lack a legal basis from higher laws”.\\nThe CAC did not respond to a request for comment. The MPS could not be reached for comment.\\nBut James Gong, a partner and data protection expert at law firm Bird & Bird, argued that the proposed rules offered users “an alternative to providing their more sensitive personal information” to internet companies and “reduces the possibility of their sensitive personal information being divulged or misused”.\\nHe added: “This is a voluntary regime for the individuals at least at this point.”\\nRecommended\\nThe MPS has published a pilot application on Chinese app stores to test the digital ID scheme. According to the app, social media platform Xiaohongshu and Alibaba-owned ecommerce giant Taobao have signed up to test the new verification scheme.\\nShen Kui, a law professor at Peking University, wrote in an article posted on a university WeChat account that a unified digital ID that captured all online activity would make users hesitant to post online and limit the “vibrancy of the digital economy”.\\nNunlist said the strong response to the proposed change underscored the importance of data protection. “There is a mistaken view that Chinese people care less about their privacy and state intrusion than other places. The apprehension over this rule change is a pretty powerful demonstration that this isn’t the case.”\\nAdditional reporting by Tina Hu in Beijing', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/63f2e491-e015-4cae-bb35-f4c447c595f1', 'title': 'China’s data watchdog plans tighter control of internet users', 'publication_time': '2024-07-31T12:45:08.446Z'}, uuid=UUID('52716fc9-1b41-40f4-b878-645f85d23a1c'), db_id=''),\n",

But the damage does not stop there; criminals can also take over customer accounts, commit financial fraud and access other banking resources, he adds.\\n“One of the key threats banks face when securing their cloud environment is attackers gaining unauthorised access through their inbound traffic, such as a customer’s online banking transactions or account opening, or outbound traffic, which includes activities such as payment processing, trading and interbank communication,” Crocker explains.\\nHe says hackers can intercept banking traffic by launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which overwhelm computer servers with large volumes of requests, as well as SQL (structured query language) injection and cross-site scripting attacks, which inject malicious code into applications and websites.\\nMoving to cloud systems is, therefore, a trade-off in terms of risk, Crocker argues. “Ultimately, banks rely on cloud service providers to deliver secure and reliable infrastructure and services,” he says. “However, vulnerabilities in cloud platforms, misconfigurations, or security weaknesses in the underlying infrastructure can expose banks to significant security risks.”\\nVulnerabilities in cloud platforms, misconfigurations, or security weaknesses in the underlying infrastructure can expose banks to significant security risks\\nBanks’ best options for mitigating these is using encrypted communication methods, such as virtual private networks, dedicated private connections and web proxy servers, Crocker advises. In addition, he recommends using network segmentation — whereby computer networks are separated into smaller parts — to limit the impact of security breaches and improve control over outbound traffic flows.\\nA bigger challenge, however, is dealing with unknown, or unaddressed, security flaws that bank IT teams have not prepared for — known as “zero-day” exploits .\\n“‘Zero-day’ describes recently discovered security vulnerabilities that hackers can use to attack systems, and literally means that an organisation under attack has ‘zero days’ to fix it,” explains Sergey Lozhkin, principal security researcher at Russian antivirus software company Kaspersky, and former vice-president of cyber security operations for JPMorgan Chase. He warns that these can give cyber criminals a strong foothold in cloud banking systems.\\nAdvanced persistent threats, or APTs, are attacks that can also go undetected, giving hackers a big advantage. “APTs\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009exploit vulnerabilities to gain prolonged access to a bank’s cloud infrastructure, allowing them to exfiltrate sensitive data over time,” says Lozhkin.\\nWhile both types of attack present significant cyber security risks, the sophisticated nature of APTs is forcing banks to step up their defences. Lozhkin points out that APT hacking techniques were instrumental in the 2016 cyber attack on South Africa’s Standard Bank Group, when cybercriminals stole $13mn by forging 1,600 cards.\\xa0“APTs are like a stealthy burglar that can sit within networks completely unseen for any length of time before striking,” he says.\\nTo mitigate zero-day exploits, Lozhkin recommends the use of advanced monitoring solutions to detect “unusual activities indicative of a zero-day attack”. Automated tools can also “streamline this process” and decrease “the window of opportunity for attackers”, he adds.\\nAnd, to mitigate APTs, he suggests threat detection solutions, network traffic analysis, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, which provide continuous cyber security monitoring and user behaviour analytics (UBA).\\nLozkhin is confident this approach will work. “By implementing a comprehensive security strategy that includes regular updates, configuration management, advanced threat detection and robust incident response plans, banks can mitigate the risks posed by zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats, protecting their assets and maintaining customer trust in an increasingly digital world,” he says.\\nHowever, Jake Moore, UK-based global cyber security adviser at Bratislava-headquartered security company ESET, fears many institutions are not taking action quickly enough. “The banking industry has been slow to adopt cloud security and this has been made slower due to the tough regulations the industry faces,” he says. “Ransomware attacks, which now commonly include data-compromising techniques, pose one of the most significant risks to financial institutions.”\\nRansomware attacks, which now commonly include data-compromising techniques, pose one of the most significant risks to financial institutions\\nAccording to Moore, implementing a “multi-layered security approach” will help banks mitigate these risks. These layers should include stringent authentication protocols — such as physical security keys, unique passwords and device identifiers — to prevent unauthorised persons from accessing cloud systems.\\nRegular security audits will also help IT teams find and fix vulnerabilities in cloud-based banking systems, he suggests, while strong encryption can make sensitive data unreadable, even if it is stolen by cyber criminals.\\nBut, with human error being the cause of most cloud security breaches, according to a report by defence group Thales , Moore urges banks to train their staff in tackling cyber threats.\\nMany can be mitigated using zero-trust models, says Tristan Morgan, managing director of security at telecoms group BT. These demand that everyone trying to use a bank’s WiFi network, whether employee or customer, is “constantly checked and validated”.\\n“It also provides visibility of who is on the network, reducing risks, and supporting the operational needs of companies in a hybrid working environment,” says Morgan.\\nBernie Wright, chief information security officer at cloud infrastructure provider ClearBank, advises banks to operate a “comprehensive supplier onboarding process”, to eradicate security risks in their supply chains. He notes that many suppliers offer software-as-a-service products (licensed on a subscription basis) that are run in the cloud and, if improperly secured, can provide hackers with backdoor access to banking clients’ IT environments.\\n“There are certain levels of trust that are needed so, as part of due diligence, it’s crucial to review how suppliers operate, their associated corporate policies, and resilience capabilities,” Wright emphasises.\\nHowever, far greater cloud computing applications — and threats — are expected to arise in coming years from quantum computers. These devices harness quantum mechanics to carry out vastly more, and faster, processing operations than today’s computers could ever manage.\\nKamran Ikram, senior managing director in financial services at the UK and Ireland arm of consultants Accenture, sees both pros and cons. “Banks can build more resilient and secure financial systems with quantum algorithms constructed to find opportunities for credit scoring and optimising trading trajectories,” he says. “But quantum computing will also allow encryption codes to be cracked in a fraction of the time they now take.”', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/2b36a642-bda5-4e43-9747-2175c4d72fd0', 'title': 'Banks moving into the cloud prompt forecasts of security risk', 'publication_time': '2024-05-02T04:00:12.100Z'}, uuid=UUID('9f65a64b-c88f-453d-aec4-4f5cc5dc130a'), db_id=''),\n",

Set to go live next year, it comes at a time when statistics agencies around the world are struggling to run big household surveys with people becoming harder to contact and less willing to give personal details to cold callers.\\nThe need to move away from survey-based collection has been thrown into sharp relief by the Office for National Statistics’ recent failure to produce reliable jobs data.\\nLievesley told the House of Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee that while “every rich country in the world” was developing something similar to the IDS, the UK — already at a disadvantage as it did not hold a population register — was making slower progress.\\n“The government really has to get a grip on this,” she said, describing the IDS as “critical” in helping “provide better services for the population”.\\nOther than funding constraints, she told MPs the main problem was that officials still saw it as risky to share data with other government departments, either because of privacy concerns or worries that it would reveal problems with the quality of the information.\\nBaroness Neville-Rolfe, a Cabinet Office minister, told the committee she accepted that “more central effort and ministerial involvement” was needed and said the government would set out plans to improve data sharing later in the year.\\nLievesley’s government-commissioned review also called for greater clarity about the governance of the statistics system. Britain is unusual in having a single body — the UK Statistics Authority — overseeing both the production of official statistics, mainly through the Office for National Statistics, and their regulation, through the Office for Statistical Regulation.\\nShe said she had seen “no tangible evidence” to support assertions that the ONS and the OSR were “too cosy”. But she urged ministers to clarify the separation of their functions and reporting arrangements in legislation, to avoid confusion that could “damage trust in official statistics”.\\nShe also said the Cabinet Office should consider splitting the role of national statistician. The position has proved difficult to fill at the salary on offer, because of the need to combine academic expertise with business acumen.\\nRecommended\\nLievesley criticised the ONS for poor communication and said the agency needed “urgently” to improve its website, which often crashes when data is released. She also called for the UKSA to appoint a non-executive director with a background in communication.\\nShe also questioned an anomaly in legislation that allows ministers to see some government statistics — although not those produced by the ONS — before their public release.\\nThe government said it had no plans to change current arrangements for the pre-release of statistics.

The ICO said employees at Serco Leisure had not been offered a clear alternative to having their faces and fingers scanned to clock in and out, saying this had been presented as a requirement to get paid.

Biometric data was “wholly unique to a person” so the risks of harm in the event of inaccuracies or a security breach were much greater, Edwards said.\\nThe ICO said it was unlikely staff would feel able to say no to the collection and use of their biometric data for attendance checks.

The failure to link these reports meant that the police had missed vital opportunities to prevent her being attacked.\\nHad Pearson been given a unique ID number, against which all her interactions with the police were recorded, officers would have been able to spot the escalating pattern of harassment and accurately assess the risk posed by the stalker — giving them the chance to intervene before she was assaulted.\\nIn some sectors of government, such as education and social care, IDs are increasingly seen as a crucial way to better services. In the justice system, however, the idea of unique IDs for victims is still just an idea.\\nIn 2023, I worked with victims’ groups to try to understand how issues with data were affecting our ability to help victims of crime. The findings were alarming — the groups reported that, at present, data on victims of crime is inconsistently collected and often not linked — within or across the agencies of the criminal justice system.\\nThe failure to introduce measures to improve the way that data about victims is collected and shared has had serious consequences — particularly for those who are subject to offences characterised by patterns of repeat behaviour, such as domestic violence, stalking and antisocial behaviour.\\nThe draft Victims and Prisoners bill, currently making its way through the House of Lords, promises to: “put victims at the heart of the criminal justice system”. It is difficult to see how it will achieve this aim, when existing data systems, which will not be reformed under the draft legislation, are set up to render victims’ true pictures and history invisible.\\nUnique IDs for victims could also support the creation of new digital services, keeping victims updated on the progress of their case and tackling one of the key causes of the dissatisfaction they have with the criminal justice process. Such a system would also create the infrastructure for monitoring compliance with the Victims Code, which sets out what victims are owed, in real time. Recording compliance with the code and linking it to the relevant victim ID would mean that those in charge could routinely monitor disparities in the experience of victims of different types of crime, or from different backgrounds — and act to address them.\\nIn terms of improving the design of services and policy, better demographic data on victims of crime, linked to the reasons why they withdraw from prosecutions, could help to create effective support services — reducing victim withdrawals and addressing one of the key drivers of cost across the criminal justice system.\\nThe failure to address existing issues with data is a problem of vision and ambition, not technical feasibility. Unique identifiers for both victims and defendants are already in use by countries such as Finland — which frequently appears near the top of international comparison indices measuring the quality of justice systems in different countries.\\nOf course, there are potential downsides to introducing IDs, including the risk that detailed information will be shared inappropriately, or used for purposes other than the improvement of services. These could be managed by giving the victims commissioner for England and Wales a role in determining permitted uses of data associated with victim IDs.\\nCreating robust data governance is vital to maintaining public trust, and making changes will require investment. But in a context where the criminal justice system is at breaking point, and victim trust and confidence is low, politicians must weigh the cost of allowing the status quo to persist, against that of taking action.\\n', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/de4dd120-1c67-4f58-9ab9-deecded78b29', 'title': 'Victims are getting lost in the justice system — IDs could help', 'publication_time': '2024-01-14T17:00:01.953Z'}, uuid=UUID('86250e78-33bb-4cbe-a3b6-d1726c482ca1'), db_id=''),\n",

This lack of clarity has raised concerns among businesses about the ramifications of transferring data out of the country.\\nMeanwhile, Vietnam’s first consolidated Personal Data Protection Decree took effect in July. It requires companies to prepare an impact assessment if they wish to transfer the personal data of Vietnamese citizens abroad.\\n“We were scrambling to help clients navigate Vietnam’s new security assessment process, which appears to have drawn some inspiration from China’s,” said Mark Parsons, a Hong Kong-based lawyer who heads Hogan Lovells’ Asia-Pacific region regulatory practice.\\nStill, most of the firm’s Asia-Pacific clients are seeking to consolidate data, Parsons said. That means instead of local storage for each market, teams on the ground remotely access servers in one particular location through security interfaces, making for more efficiency and security.\\nThis article is from Nikkei Asia , a global publication with a uniquely Asian perspective on politics, the economy, business and international affairs. Our own correspondents and outside commentators from around the world share their views on Asia, while our Asia300 section provides in-depth coverage of 300 of the biggest and fastest-growing listed companies from 11 economies outside Japan.\\nSubscribe | Group subscriptions\\nParsons said because of the increasingly strict data and cyber security laws, China is not the typical choice for regional consolidation. Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia still head the list of popular jurisdictions.\\nThe huge and growing demand for data centres in Asia is fuelled primarily by the rapid advancement of technologies such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality. Other factors, such as China’s transition towards a cashless society, the development of 5G and 6G networks and increasing demands for digital sovereignty, are also adding to growth.\\nThe Asia-Pacific market for data centres is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 12 per cent from 2023 to 2027 and will reach $48bn by 2027, according to consultancy Renub Research.\\nThere were 449 data centres in China as of the end of 2023, the most by far in the Asia-Pacific region, followed by Australia, Japan and India, according to Cloudscene, a connectivity directory for co-location data centres, or facilities that rent out space to house servers.\\n“The explosive growth of data has brought much attention to data centres, and their number is only going to increase,” said Larry Liu, who leads the communication, media, and technology business at insurance broker Marsh Asia in Shanghai.\\nThis rapid growth is starting to push the industry beyond its usual hubs and into more countries, he added. For example, demand for data centres is very strong across south-east Asia, where societies are quickly going digital.\\n“Some companies still have their regional or global headquarters in Singapore, but they are expanding their data centre portfolio into countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and even the Philippines, due to cost considerations,” Liu said.\\nBut the growth is a double-edged sword, he added. While more data centres will mean improved back-up and redundancy, the subsequent increase in the usage of endpoint devices such as phones and tablets, as well as more interconnected facilities, also will mean more points that can be targeted by hackers.\\nUS-China tensions are another complication. In October, Washington updated its export controls to require companies to apply for a licence if they want to ship cutting-edge AI chips to clients in China and certain other markets. These tighter controls expand the already sweeping export restrictions introduced in 2022 that aimed to curtail Beijing’s ambitions in the chip manufacturing sector.\\nExperts say these restrictions will add another layer to the complexity of building data centres in China, particularly for some sectors.\\n“If technology is localised in addition to data, it gets even messier,” Parsons said. “If, for example, a US company wishes to use AI technology in its Chinese businesses, it will probably need to be able to take data from China to train and maintain that AI.”\\nBut despite the rising risks and complexity, Mark Bennett, technology and real estate counsel at Hogan Lovells in Sydney, says companies building data centres will be guided first and foremost by return on investment.\\n“A very good friend of mine who’s in the area ran through all the risks and challenges about where to set up his company’s data centre site,” Bennett said. “At the end of the day, he turned to me and said that it’s wherever they can get the biggest return.

It is not clear how many applications have been submitted in total. The CAC stopped publishing figures on approvals in May. It did not respond to requests for comment.\\nWhile the regulator should, by law, complete a data security review within 57 working days of receiving an application, most companies spend many months waiting for feedback, officials said. The feedback often includes requests for further information.\\n“Not a single company can complete data security review within the officially suggested timeframe as the CAC would either ask them to correct formatting or submit more materials,” said a CAC official, adding that some companies had to make changes to their applications more than a dozen times to meet regulatory requirements. “The whole process becomes very time consuming,” the official said.\\nAnalysts said the CAC’s struggle to implement data export rules highlights the challenges facing Beijing as it seeks to achieve the conflicting goals of boosting economic growth and strengthening national security.\\n“Before, it was implicitly understood that growth was sort of prioritised,” said Karman Lucero, a researcher at Yale Law School. “Now the dynamics totally shifted, where folks recognise more explicitly that there is this contradiction between those two goals and increasingly the government is choosing security regardless of what they say.”\\nSince September 2022, Beijing has required operators of critical information infrastructure, companies handling data deemed crucial for national security and those with access to large volumes of user information to pass a CAC-led security assessment before sending data abroad.\\nBy early May, just two companies in Shanghai, a hub for international trade, had won regulatory approval to transfer data abroad.

       "  (Document(text='\\nPeter Barber\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nAre you ready to share your entire financial life online? It’s called ‘open banking’ and it just took a big step forward in the world’s biggest market.\\nLast month, US regulators announced measures to allow consumers’ financial data to be shared easily, following similar reforms in Europe and Australia that make it simpler to switch bank accounts and sign up for a range of financial products.\\nBanks “know every time you tap your card, they see you got the [train], and you go get your coffee, and you’re spending your money there,” points out Philip Benton, an analyst at tech research group Omdia and an expert on digital banking. “They [already] have all that data. [So] the whole point of open banking and finance is opening that up to the wider ecosystem.”\\nThat is being made possible in the US by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under a new Personal Financial Data Rights rule that will, for the first time, guarantee Americans access to their data held at a bank or other provider at no charge. As a result, customers will be able to share that data with third parties — which will be subject to limits on how they use it — or revoke access to the data at any time.\\n“With the right consumer protections in place, a shift towards open and decentralised banking can supercharge competition, improve financial products and services, and discourage junk fees,” argues CFPB Director Rohit Chopra.\\nThis right to control your data is one reason it is much simpler to change banks in, say, the UK, than in the US. “Account ownership is sticky in the US, where you are more likely to get divorced than to switch bank accounts,” observes John Pitts, the global head of policy for US fintech Plaid, and a former CFPB official.\\nSuch portability of personal data, says Pitts, would also allow consumers to pick and choose “different products that either their bank doesn’t offer or [does] offer but someone else offers a version that better matches your need”. A customer would be able to use those more suitable products without leaving their main bank.\\nCountries to watch 2023-2027\\nVietnam The success of local payment network NAPAS has boosted digital payments growth, with cardholders expected to more than double by 2027\\nAustralia The real-time payment network PayTo, launched last year, will see increasing adoption over next five years as new use cases emerge\\nSaudi Arabia Fintech is a key aspect of the country’s goal of payments among individuals to be 70 per cent digital by 2025\\nSingapore\\nThe city-state’s authorities have bold ambitions for a QR-code based payment system\\nSource: FT-Omdia Digital Economies Index\\nOpen banking began as a UK government initiative in 2018, as part of Europe-wide efforts to foster competition and innovation, and break the stranglehold of legacy providers on personal finance. The biggest British banks were forced to share their customers’ data with third parties such as fintechs for the first time, under the authorisation of those customers.\\nFive years in, the results vary. Progress in achieving the aims of Europe’s Payment Services Directive Two, which implemented open banking in the EU, has been “disparate”, according to Daniel Jones, a partner at law firm Orrick who specialises in technology and finance.\\n“There are many, many jurisdictions I think in the EU that aren’t meeting the expectations set by the law,” he says.\\nEven the country that started it all has gone only so far. Jones says that, in the UK, the reforms have only had an effect on bank accounts and credit cards. “We are yet to really unlock the potential, which is the ability to compare things like mortgages or pensions,” adds Jones.\\nWhat happens in the US is therefore being keenly watched. While there is already widespread use of fintech apps that make use of customers’ data from other financial firms, that information is often gathered through “screen-scraping”, whereby bots copy it from a website using the customer’s log-in details. This can be unreliable and carries risks, including having more data than necessary taken by the third party.\\nIn the US, the new open banking rule will require that, as in the UK, banks provide application programming interfaces (APIs), which allow data to be easily shared. The CFPB says its rule will “require data providers to establish and maintain a developer interface for third parties to access consumer-authorised data”.\\nIn the UK, the huge cost of implementing the technological changes fell solely on the big banks, and not on the fintechs who stood to benefit from access to their networks — which caused conflict.\\n“I’m aware of certain large deposit-taking banks that have spent over half a billion [pounds],” says Jones.\\nIn the US, the problem is that, while Wall St institutions can bear the costs, there are thousands of small and medium-sized providers that might struggle. The CFPB notes that “there are more than 9,000 banks and credit unions across the country, most of which serve as data providers, as do numerous non-depository financial institutions”. Making all those financial institutions work seamlessly together is likely to be a Herculean task.\\nAccording to the Fintech Brain Food newsletter, written by commentator Simon Taylor, the fact that the CFPB rule does not let banks charge for API access “will further reinforce the perception that open banking has zero upside for incumbents and all downside”. He proposes some form of revenue-sharing, in which banks could receive a small transaction fee when customers use open banking via third parties.\\nHowever, the Consumer Bankers Association, which represents retail banks, has welcomed the new rule, which also seeks to regulate fintech companies. “Many of these entities that are collecting, storing and selling this consumer information are not subject to the same rigorous data security and privacy standards as well-regulated and supervised financial institutions,” it pointed out.\\nAnd the Financial Technology Association — the fintechs’ lobby group — says the rule will bring consumers “one step closer to having a strong right to control their financial data”.\\nIn addition, the regulatory changes should bring the US closer to the wider vision of Open Finance: having your entire financial life — spanning your deposit account, pension, mortgage, insurance and share portfolio — instantly available in the one place, and easily portable to different providers. Benton notes that Australia started with this idea — an open data rule that would expand to cover everything.\\nBut steep barriers to fully Open Finance remain.\\nThe first is a “huge trust issue” between the traditional banks and the third parties, says Jones. One unanswered question is who is liable in the event of fraud or the loss of data. What is needed, says Jones, is either clear legislation or a “killer app”.\\nIn a recent Omdia survey on open banking, the top priorities of the banks were online security and protecting against fraud.\\nPitts agrees that the question of trust is key. “When I think about a bank, the image for me is a vault — and the vault conveys trust in a deeply meaningful way,” he says. “I think you need that same level of trust in open banking, and that means appropriate regulation and policies and procedures when it comes to fraud and privacy.”', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/e0203daa-1eca-46fd-a122-f6b4e5e29ec2', 'title': 'America embraces Open Banking', 'publication_time': '2023-11-07T05:30:12.112Z'}, uuid=UUID('66ba2191-ed1a-414f-a1f0-ccb390cbebbc'), db_id=''),\n",

In recent months NHS staff and medical trade unions have voiced concerns about its suitability to run national health systems, as well as the dangers of the service relying on a single private company for critical functions.\\nHealth secretary Victoria Atkins said the platform “will sit across NHS trusts and integrated care systems, allowing them to connect data they already hold, such as health records, waiting lists, and theatre and staff rosters, in a safe and secure environment, to better manage patient care”.\\nShe added: “The FDP will support key priorities of the NHS, including recovery of elective care and the improvement of discharge processes to get medically fit patients treated and home quicker.”\\nNHS England said the software would enable staff to “plan and maximise resources such as operating theatre and outpatient clinic time to ensure patients receive more timely care”.\\nIn response to the concerns about private sector companies’ access to NHS data, Atkins insisted that “data will not leave the UK”.\\nThe terms of the contract forbid the use of patient data for commercial gain, but human rights group Amnesty International said the deal had “huge implications for data protection”, adding that Palantir should give “cast-iron guarantees” that it will not monetise health data.\\n“The public who rely on the NHS need to have confidence that their informed consent will be obtained at all stages of data-gathering,” said Peter Frankental, Amnesty International UK’s business and human rights director, “and assurance that their personal information won’t be harvested by Palantir for purposes that have little to do with their health”.\\nFormer minister David Davis, who has been outspoken against the contract being awarded to Palantir, said: “The NHS does not understand how sensitive, delicate and dangerous public health data is. “You can’t anonymise medical data\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009it’s too rich, you just can’t do it.”\\nRecommended\\nResponding to the announcement, Palantir’s Karp said: “This award is the culmination of 20 years of developing software that enables complex, sensitive data to be integrated in a way that protects security, respects privacy and puts the customer in full control.\\n“There is no more important institution in the UK than the NHS and we are humbled to have now been chosen to provide that software across England to help bring down waiting lists, improve patient care and reduce health inequality.”\\nVin Diwakar, NHS England’s national medical director for secondary care, said: “Better use of data is essential for the NHS to tackle waiting times, join up patient care and make the health service sustainable for the future.”\\nAdditional reporting by Anna Gross in London', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/18ed74ae-b987-4cad-aafa-8be4b6e638ce', 'title': 'US tech group Palantir wins lucrative NHS data contract', 'publication_time': '2023-11-21T16:13:03.532Z'}, uuid=UUID('b8f4d7b2-a6d4-446a-84f3-cb1ba47a659c'), db_id=''),\n",

Here, the platform tries to predict which companies or jobs candidates might be interested in, other than those they overtly search for.\\nIndeed is using its members’ data in a similar way. “Sure, we extract structured information from résumés and job descriptions,” says Raj Mukherjee, executive vice-president for employer at Indeed, “but jobseekers and employers share so much more with us about their skills and preferences. We get intent and behavioural signals, data from two-way messages, and 12mn interviews.”\\nBy identifying a user’s intent and better matching their skills to roles, the platform aims to display vacancies that jobseekers might otherwise have missed.\\nSam Franklin, chief executive and co-founder of London-based tech recruitment company Otta, says its job-matching model gives candidates even greater control.\\nAs well as their CVs, jobseekers can input their skills and preferences, such as salary expectations, working patterns, and values. These data points are then used to match candidates to a curated selection of jobs, which Franklin says will be more relevant. The model is “supportive of jobseekers, supportive of topics like diversity and inclusion”, he argues.\\nFranklin says candidates’ perception of an employer’s brand is increasingly important. So, for each job posting, he or co-founder and chief operating officer Theo Margolius write “Otta’s take” — an overview of the hiring employer. Details listed include notes on employer response times, employee endorsements, funding rounds, and diversity and inclusion initiatives.\\nRecommended\\nMark Chaffey, chief executive of hackajob, another tech-focused UK jobs aggregator, agrees that corporate reputations are increasingly important to candidates.\\nJobseekers who sign up to hackajob can follow companies, like they would on LinkedIn, and view content they post, but it is the companies that approach potential candidates about a job.\\n“It’s a way to change the engagement dynamic,” Chaffey says. “A candidate can show interest in an organisation, but not necessarily apply for a job. It’s more the idea that you [as an employer] can then share events, podcasts, and content to ‘warm’ that candidate.”\\nHackajob’s candidates, who indicate preferences in areas such as salary and sector, are screened before they are made visible to employers. This means companies see only suitable candidates, says Chaffey, while jobseekers are only approached by companies that meet their expectations in “tech stack, location, hybrid policy”. He adds that 90 per cent of candidates respond to recruiters’ initial outreach within seven days.\\nUnlike platforms such as LinkedIn, hackajob charges clients a subscription. Chaffey says its “level of candidate engagement” enables clients to achieve significant cost savings compared with the fees charged by traditional recruitment agencies.\\nAlongside self-search, LinkedIn, Indeed and Otta also allow recruiters to contact candidates who are not actively job hunting. In addition, LinkedIn is adding an AI tool that will allow recruiters to conduct searches using ‘natural language’ prompts, such as “I want a London-based data analyst”.\\n“It’s much more intuitive,” says Srinivasan. “We can start suggesting companies or things you’ve never heard of.”\\nBut skills are an increasingly important element of focus, for candidates and recruiters alike. LinkedIn members added more than 500mn skills to their profiles over the past 12 months, Srinivasan says.\\n“People are getting hired a lot more based on their skills,” he says. “We have had hundreds of millions coming in and adding proof to their skills [to their profile].

This anonymised information is then sold to advertisers so they can target specific categories, or segments, with personalised marketing.\\nAn investigation by the non-profit Irish Council for Civil Liberties published on Tuesday shows the number of segments is greater than previously thought, including data on many influential and sensitive professions that were not known to be sold to advertisers.\\nData has been put into segments used to target judges, elected officials, military personnel and “decision makers” working in national security, it found.\\nPrivacy campaigners argue that these more specific professional categories mean that information from different data points can be easily combined with location data and time stamps to identify people.\\nThis could be used for surveillance or exploited by hostile actors, they added, noting that the data is available for a broad range of companies to purchase.\\n“This data about political leaders, judges and military personnel shows that the [real-time bidding] industry’s security problem is in fact a national security problem too,” said Johnny Ryan, senior fellow at ICCL.\\nReal-time bidding is the process by which advertising is bought and sold based on data segments.\\nA document seen by the Financial Times showed that segments marketed by US data broker firm Eyeota include decision makers in government, national security and counter-terrorism.\\nThey also included categories such as military personnel, military families, judges and elected officials.\\nDun & Bradstreet, which owns Eyeota, said “it offers audience data segments in a privacy-compliant and globally consistent way” and that the segments are “pseudonymised, which means that they do not contain any identifiable data elements”.\\nOther data available through the broker includes personal information, such as whether an individual is likely to have an interest in “erectile disfunction [sic]”, their sexual orientation, job satisfaction and financial circumstances.\\nCarissa Veliz, an associate professor at Oxford university, specialising in digital ethics, said that “although platforms claim data is anonymised, it is actually very hard to do in practice; you only need two or three data points to identify somebody”.\\n“Platforms know the anonymisation they are doing is so fragile, and they know what they are doing is identifying sensitive information that could endanger people and society,” she added. “Identifying sensitive jobs opens those people up to harms like extortion or blackmail, which can also impact democracy.”\\nGoogle and Microsoft send data about users in the US and Europe to hundreds of companies that then use it to buy personalised advertising slots.\\nThis has included sending the data to Chinese and Russian companies, either directly or through brokers. These companies are bound by local laws that permit state security agencies to access such information.\\n“To protect people’s privacy, we have the strictest restrictions in the industry on the types of data we share in real-time bidding,” Google said.\\n“Our real-time bidding policies simply don’t allow bad actors to compromise people’s privacy and security,” it added.\\nMicrosoft-owned Xandr facilitates the sale of segmented information on its data marketplace, which has included categories such as whether a person suffers from depression or anxiety, as well as whether individuals have been searching for support on sexual abuse.\\n“We take these matters seriously, and we regularly evaluate [privacy policies] to ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws,” Microsoft said.\\nRecommended\\nOne example identified by the ICCL from a Russian data broker included people who visit “political opposition websites”.\\n“That is particularly worrying because it would expose a person who is visiting such a website to the unfriendly attentions of the Russian government and adds to the questions over why Google sees fit to broadcast this data about the online activities of people in this manner,” Ryan said.\\nGoogle said it paused serving ads in Russia and suspended RTB partners based in Russia in early 2022.

       "  (Document(text='\\nEmma Jacobs\\nSwiping right for love would have baffled Mr Rochester but the brooding anti-hero might have found one new dating feature all too familiar.\\xa0This week, some 170 years after the publication of Jane Eyre , Tinder announced that the dating app would add Matchmaker , which enables parents and friends to scour profiles and recommend a selection for dates. Or, as Tinder put it in words that would have made Charlotte Brontë blanch: bringing “your circle of trust into your dating journey”.\\nHelp isn’t exactly new in internet dating. My Single Friend encouraged mates to write profiles back in 2005. (The site’s now a shadow of its heyday.) Surely most people have swiped right on a friend’s behalf, after they’ve handed their phone over?\\nMark Brooks, a consultant to dating apps, says he has seen several matchmaking features. “Indian apps have been doing this for years.” One single man from India noted on the online news site The Print: “I’ve matched with over 105 [women] in the past four months. But roughly 80 per cent of the accounts are run by their parents.” Matrimonial sites such as Shaadi.com let users say if their profile was created by themselves, a sibling, friend or parent.\\nFor those in the west, Brooks says, matchmaking features can be “amusing”, even “transformative”. We can be delusional about ourselves and our interests — notably our athleticism. “Some people really need a little reality check\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009Friends or family can [also] spot potential red flags in profiles.”\\nIt is not without its risks, however. One friend who was set up on an old-fashioned blind date by friends fumed: “Is this what they think of me?”\\nCan parental matchmaking backfire? Certainly it did for Mr Rochester, whose first bride Bertha Mason was “courted” for him by his father, before becoming gripped by mental illness. It didn’t work out so well for her either — locked in the attic, before jumping from the roof.\\nThere are literary warnings about parental disapproval, too — that it would only intensify love was the basis of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. Such defiance is a potent idea but Colleen Sinclair, associate research professor at Louisiana State University, points out the limits to wider learning: “If you remember, [Romeo and Juliet’s] relationship didn’t last.”\\nA few years ago, Sinclair conducted an experiment to see if Americans would take advice regarding online dates. “Friends tend to be the primary source of relationship advice.” Once a searcher decided on a keeper, then came parents’ opinions. Those believing in love at first sight won’t seek views, but most are pragmatic. “Ultimately when you have lots of choices we like things that help us narrow them down. Whenever we’re in a situation which [has] no script, our instinct is to go to others for help.”\\nSuch filters may prove even more helpful in a dating pool swimming with too much choice, bots and time wasters. A recent study by Stanford University found a large percentage of Tinder users were not looking for dates, with almost two-thirds already in a relationship. One of the authors said many “reported using the app for social connectedness, for entertainment and distraction”. In other words, like any social network. Grindr, the gay site, found anecdotal evidence of people using it to create “professional opportunities like jobs” — one dubbed it a “ horny LinkedIn ”.\\nAs a parent, the prospect of checking out an offspring’s dating life is tantalising. Tech already gives nosy parents so many snooping opportunities. School apps relay children’s progress in real time; phone tracking surveys their physical whereabouts.\\nAnd yet, just because something is possible does not make it wise. Interfering might not ruin a budding relationship, but this constant presence does little to cultivate independence — something Jane Eyre knew the value of, too.\\nemma.jacobs@ft.com\\n', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a21f61f6-174f-4bf1-abe7-c71e4c05d839', 'title': 'Tinder and the old-fashioned art of matchmaking', 'publication_time': '2023-10-28T04:00:37.884Z'}, uuid=UUID('64658343-a7ab-4e69-a94d-945c4225bdac'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nLaura Noonan\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nAs much as many of us value human interaction, there are some tasks that artificial intelligence performs much better than any person. Verifying customer identity is one of them, according to online finance specialists.\\nAs anyone who has ever opened a bank account online or in the flesh knows, a document with your photo will almost universally be required as proof of identity.\\nIn a bank branch, a clerk will look at you and your passport or driving licence, for example, to see if they match. Or, if you apply online, you’ll be asked to take a picture of the identity document and your face, which will then be read by a machine. And the technology will probably be more accurate in analysing the images than the bank employee.\\n“Humans are not particularly great at recognising humans,” explains Yuelin Li, chief product officer at UK-based digital identity verification provider Onfido She points to studies showing that machines are better than ordinary people at recognising faces and just as good as “professional facial examiners”, who are more likely to be employed in law enforcement than by banks.\\nRecommended\\nThere are many reasons for machines’ superiority in facial recognition. Li says humans can struggle with reconciling how someone looks currently with ID card photos that could be years old, and matching a 3D image of a real person to a 2D one. Machines are more precise because they can use measurements of, for example, the distance between facial features and the size of marks to figure out if the person and the photo match.\\nMachines are also much more experienced than even the most skilled bank clerk. Li says Onfido uses a machine-learning model, which improves the accuracy of the technology powering its system over time. It can also, at the request of clients, check whether someone has previously tried to link the same face to a different name.\\nOnfido also offers verification using other documents, such as utility bills. It looks at the document to verify an address, checks if there is a valid issue date, and whether the template looks reasonable. Fundamentally, though, the advice the company gives to financial institutions is that the use of records such as utility bills is not the most secure way to verify someone’s identity.\\nLi says online customer onboarding — taking a client on to a banking or investment platform and setting them up — is more secure than more traditional approaches because it is now typically done entirely within a bank or payment provider app. “One of the things people are very nervous about is [using] things like call centres,” she says. “A lot of attacks that are going on now — a phishing attack or a text message or something — they [criminals] get you because you’re coming out of the app.”\\nThat helps explain why online verification has become mainstream in recent years, with Li noting that the “vast majority” of onboarding is now online, among the traditional and new institutions that Onfido works with in the UK.\\nRevolut, a UK fintech that doesn’t have physical branches, has more than 30mn online customers worldwide. Its head of financial crime and fraud, Aaron Elliott-Gross, says the company uses a combination of internal models and systems alongside services from vendors to deal with the “constant threat” of, for example, AI-generated images and deep fakes being passed off as ‘selfie’ videos of real people.\\n“They [the vendors] check to make sure the selfie is live, they check to make sure there’s motion, and the vendors are very good at this. We provide an additional layer [of checks] on top of this because we see so many onboards that we think we have something to add\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009to see if there’s anything we can detect that’s unusual.”\\nElliott-Gross stresses that facial recognition and verifying documents such as bills are the “basic building blocks” but that much more sophisticated checks happen behind the scenes. “It’s really what you do beyond that differentiates you\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009It’s very obvious [to the potential new customer] that we’re verifying documents, it’s very obvious that we’re verifying data,” he says. “We run a lot of modelling on top of that.\\n“[We] say, let’s not just look at the data a customer gave us, let’s look at other signals we have about that customer — say [what the] IP address on their mobile device looks like, the history we have on their phone number or email address [which Revolut can get from data providers] to figure out whether that customer is a genuine onboard or fraudulent.”\\nRevolut is also using its identity tools for more than onboarding. For example, it can verify that people still have control of their accounts if they switch phones or if they are make an unusually large payment. This ensures that, if a phone is stolen, the thief won’t then be able to execute a large transaction from the victim’s account.\\nThe fintech is also “very interested” in the evolving field of behavioural biometrics , which involves profiling, for example, the angle at which a user typically holds a device, and the speed at which they press its buttons or type. All these idiosyncrasies can help to authenticate identity once the user has been onboarded.', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/2c5291ae-2f31-439d-8176-a669a88d41e0', 'title': 'Why is technology best for checking bank customer identities?', 'publication_time': '2023-10-23T04:00:44.501Z'}, uuid=UUID('c221c68a-bd6d-4fcf-a376-64383cd3cf29'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nJohn Thornhill\\nSome drivers and employees may be startled to discover what lies buried deep within the 9,500-word privacy notice of Nissan North America listing all the personal data the car company might collect. The categories extend to “race, national origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, sexual activity, precise geolocation, health diagnosis data, and genetic information”.\\nNissan says it might also draw inferences about psychological trends, behaviours, attitudes and intelligence. And it might share anonymised data with unspecified third-party service providers as well as using it for its own marketing and operational purposes.\\nCar companies nowadays boast they are as much in the software as the hardware business, building “computers on wheels” stuffed with cameras, microphones and sensors. That software can run useful services, such as route mapping, cruise control and the ability to stream “Mustang Sally” while speeding along the highway. But a report released this week by the Mozilla Foundation on the privacy policies of 25 car brands found the industry also operated an extensive side hustle selling data. “Modern cars are a privacy nightmare,” the report concluded.\\nFrom privacy notices that are never read to data-sharing practices that are never explained to patchy regulations that are rarely enforced, our data economy is a wicked mess. We do not expect to read a water company’s terms and conditions before we turn on a tap. Why should it be different with data? We can, and must, clean up the digital economy. Some neat ideas are now emerging around how to do so.\\nThe Mozilla report exposes many of the flaws of the data economy, extending way beyond the car industry. One core principle espoused by regulators and industry associations is that companies should only collect the minimum data needed to run their services. All 25 car brands failed on that count. Nineteen stipulated they might sell data to third parties. The majority said they would also share such data with government or law enforcement agencies in response to a “request”.\\nWorse, most car companies offer only an illusion of user consent. Tesla, to which Mozilla gave the most privacy warnings, tells owners they can contact the company to stop it collecting data. But helpfully adds: “This may result in your vehicle suffering from reduced functionality, serious damage, or inoperability.” The industry’s terrible record for cyber security adds to concerns.\\nOne powerful argument explaining how to seize back “the means of computation” is made by Cory Doctorow in his latest book The Internet Con . His top-down solution for encouraging real consumer choice and greater competition is to mandate interoperability between tech platforms, as enshrined in the EU’s Digital Markets Act.\\nSo, for example, Facebook users face painful switching costs if they move to another social network because they would lose all access to their community and content. But in a fully interoperable world, users could easily transport their “social graph” (their network of relationships) to another service they prefer.\\nThat may dovetail with attempts to build a safer internet infrastructure from the bottom up. One intriguing attempt to do so is Project Liberty, a $100mn not-for-profit initiative backed by the philanthropist Frank McCourt, which has released an open-source protocol allowing developers to build privacy-preserving apps and services. “Being able to access and control your own data is the core of the problem and our solution,” says Martina Larkin, Project Liberty’s chief executive.\\nAttempting to redesign an industry dominated by some of the richest and most powerful companies in history is a near-insurmountable challenge. Few believe that much is likely to change unless there is a sea-change in the public’s mentality and more Big Tech companies jump on board to support a US federal privacy law.\\nBut Larkin suggests we might reach a tipping point if we see the mass manipulation of the 65 elections due to be held next year. In total, about 4bn people are eligible to vote in polls, including in India, the US, Indonesia, Mexico and the UK, amid fears that generative artificial intelligence could weaponise disinformation campaigns drawing on personal voter data. “AI is accelerating everything including the need for solutions,” Larkin tells me.\\nIn the meantime, we should all read those infernal terms and conditions, lambast the car companies (and others) for their dreadful privacy standards, support safer data initiatives and press our legislators to promote competition.\\njohn.thornhill@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/dd4d11e4-282a-46f9-9234-963374165fe5', 'title': 'Clean data must be as much of a right as clean water', 'publication_time': '2023-09-14T12:15:00.835Z'}, uuid=UUID('0f00be1b-2fc7-434a-bd87-59a3628e3f15'), db_id=''),\n",

Human rights groups said this left information open to misuse and businesses complained it made their position vulnerable.\\nVaishnaw said the new law differed from the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation “because it is not prescriptive”.\\nThe law encompasses the “well-established principles” of data protection, Vaishnaw said, including limits on the purpose for which data can be\\xa0collected and how long it can be stored while taking a more “flexible” approach than in the EU, he said.\\nIndia has suffered a number of high-profile breaches in recent years, most recently in June when researchers said sensitive data was leaked from government-linked vaccination databases . The government denied there had been a breach.\\nThe data protection law has been years in the making, gathering momentum after the Supreme Court ruled in 2017 that Indians had a fundamental right to privacy. Multiple versions of the bill were floated and subsequently revised after backlash from business groups, civil society advocates and opposition politicians.\\nThe latest draft was ultimately adopted with minimal resistance, passing the upper house by a voice vote after opposition politicians — who wanted the bill sent to committee for further review — walked out of the chamber.\\nThe latest version addressed some business concerns , including loosening restrictions on companies’ ability to transfer data overseas.\\n“It’s much more business-friendly and, I feel, much more practical,” said Arun Prabhu, a Bengaluru-based partner and head of technology and telecom with law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.\\nThe law also mandates the creation of a government-controlled data protection board responsible for tracking compliance.\\nHowever, the law remains a source of concern to civil society activists, who say exemptions for the government from data protections amount to a greenlight for state surveillance.\\nRecommended\\nOne provision allows the government to bypass aspects of the bill on broad grounds relating to the “sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, maintenance of public order”.\\n“The government is one of the largest collectors of personal information in the world. They’re now through this legislation giving themselves carte blanche,” said Salman Waris, managing partner at Delhi-based law firm TechLegis. “It’s saying this act is only going to be applicable to private companies and individuals, which defeats the purpose of the act itself.”\\nVaishnaw, the IT minister, defended the bill. “All the experts are very clear that there is no exception given which is outside the constitution,” he said, adding that the law had only four exemptions, compared with 16 under the EU’s GDPR.', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/0497011e-991a-4a2e-b496-67ae67a4f650', 'title': 'India passes landmark data protection bill', 'publication_time': '2023-08-10T08:52:05.768Z'}, uuid=UUID('1b9599eb-4ab6-4f96-810d-85b3b5cb570b'), db_id=''),\n",

The goal is to offer greater protection and oversight in the collection, processing and storage of sensitive data such as individuals’ email addresses or credit card details.\\nAbhijit Dubey, chief executive of the overseas division of Japanese telecoms company NTT, said that demand from governments for data to be stored within their own countries meant more facilities, especially in smaller cities, now needed to be built.\\n“Many governments are focused on maintaining data sovereignty and ensuring that critical data is not being stored and moved across the globe,” Dubey told the Financial Times. “As more and more countries ask for localised data, they will need more data centre capacity locally, which is a net positive for us.”\\nDubey said that in previous years data tended to be stored in large global data centre hubs such as London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris that served many countries. However, he said that more are now being built in “tier-two cities”, citing Manchester and Warsaw as examples.\\nTokyo-based NTT, which is the third largest data centre operator after Equinix and Digital Realty, operates in 20 countries with centres in London, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. Having recently built a centre in Bonn, it plans to build others or expand existing facilities in Zurich, Madrid and Vienna.\\n“Increasing data sovereignty rules compels content providers to reassess this [global hub] strategy and diversify their data storage requirements across more markets,” said Nathan Luckey, a senior managing director at Macquarie Asset Management.\\nThe infrastructure-focused asset manager invested in NTT’s data centre business in Europe and North America last year.\\nGDPR has been adopted as a global standard by many companies but some countries have also implemented their own data sovereignty legislation or guidance. Germany in 2018 introduced a law that restricts data transfers to third countries, while France has established a scheme that grants cloud companies a security certification aligned with GDPR.\\nThe penalties of falling foul of data protection legislation can be steep. In May, Facebook owner Meta was fined a record €1.2bn by the Irish regulator for transferring personal data of European users to the US without adequate data protection mechanisms.\\nRecommended\\nHowever Tom Glover, head of Emea data centre transactions at real estate adviser JLL, argued it is the explosion of data, which will grow even faster because of artificial intelligence, that is driving demand for data centres in addition to data sovereignty.\\n“GDPR and data protection laws will force data generated in Germany to remain in Germany, so of course, that means that you need data centres in Germany,” he said. “But what drives the growth in data centres is the sheer volume of data that’s getting created, stored and analysed.”\\nPredictions that conventional data centres will be in demand are a fillip for the sector as the world’s biggest tech groups such as Amazon and Google shift from using third-party facilities to develop their own. Last year veteran short seller Jim Chanos announced he would be betting against the sector , arguing that cloud computing would make bricks-and-mortar providers redundant.\\nDigital Realty this week lowered its full-year earnings guidance after a sharp drop in the amount of space leased to large tech companies in the Americas.', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a2b5cfae-c911-47d8-8fc9-9ef91aef082b', 'title': 'Data sovereignty push boosting demand for digital infrastructure, says NTT', 'publication_time': '2023-07-30T04:00:10.528Z'}, uuid=UUID('f77ff3cf-166e-4884-b5cc-5771cb2bcefa'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nAlan Beattie\\nThe lost tribe of disillusioned Twitter users, fleeing the barely-moderated brawl they say the app’s new owner Elon Musk has fostered in their favoured public square, are roaming the fractured social media landscape in search of refuge. An obvious haven is Threads, a newly launched sister app to Instagram, owned by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta. But the EU’s Twitter refugees are so far denied sanctuary. Threads remains unlaunched in the bloc, apparently until regulators implementing the EU’s Digital Markets Act have sorted out whether the app’s sharing of data with Instagram could create a dangerous concentration of market power.\\nIt’s a good example for those warning that the digital world is splintering into three empires centred on the US, the EU and China. The argument is ably made in a forthcoming book by Anu Bradford, the Columbia University academic who popularised the idea of the “Brussels Effect” — the EU exporting its regulations through market power — and thinks the same is happening with digital governance.\\nThe division is already obvious in the regulation of personal data. The US allows corporations a freer rein to use and transfer information, while the EU regulates to protect individuals’ privacy. China — copied by other autocratic regimes — is increasingly walling off its realm such that no data escapes state attention or leaves without permission. And economically interventionist (not to say protectionist) nations like India increasingly force companies to keep data at home to mine it for value.\\nIn practice, as Bradford makes clear — her arguments are far more nuanced than the hubristic official EU talking points which frequently reference them — the divisions aren’t absolute, at least not between the US and EU. ( China is a very different matter. ) Differences in regulatory philosophy and persistent legal uncertainty haven’t prevented bilateral data flows between the EU and US economies becoming the biggest such exchange in the world .\\nA patchwork of partial official deals and corporate ingenuity has just about held together an international data transfer system between the democratic advanced market economies. But it’s an uncomfortably jury-rigged arrangement subject to judicial challenge, regulatory whim and governments bent on data protectionism.\\nTo protect transatlantic information exchange, Washington and Brussels are currently having their third go inside a decade at creating a lasting data transfer bridge. The previous versions (Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield) were struck down by the European Court of Justice in cases brought by Max Schrems, the Austrian privacy activist. Naturally Schrems is now promising to tilt at the new version.\\nWithout formal data-sharing agreements, data controllers in the EU and elsewhere use other tools such as so-called “ standard contractual clauses ” — officially-sanctioned private legal agreements about the use of personal information. They do provide some certainty but require extra documentation and cost.\\nBrussels also has a unilateral tool to extend its regulatory reach: its data “adequacy ” findings are a stamp of approval for a partner country’s data regulation which allows personal information freely to be exchanged with the EU. Recent estimates published by the Centre for Economic Policy Research show that a grant of adequacy is followed by a significant increase in digital trade with the EU. This is a familiar pattern from earlier generations of regulation, on things such as cars or chemicals: complying with EU rules is a pain, but there are rich rewards once you do.\\nHowever, adequacy falls well short of a reliable international system. Only 15 countries or territories have achieved it, and it’s a unilateral designation the EU can withdraw at short notice.\\nThere’s no single regime governing the more open and free-flowing US-inspired model, though Asia-Pacific organisations such as the Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) forum and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) trade deal encourage members to commit to the free cross-border transfer of data.\\nThe post-Brexit UK will be an interesting test case as it attempts to straddle multiple systems. Having obtained an adequacy finding from the EU, Britain is now joining both CPTPP and CBPR. But the EU remains by far the UK’s biggest partner for cross-border data flow. Like British businesses in many other sectors clamouring to stay close to EU regulations, the baseline for UK tech companies is to maintain Brussels’s adequacy finding.\\nBradford contends that a permissive system like the US’s creates too many issues with personal privacy and overmighty tech giants to be sustainable, and that governments are gravitating towards the EU regulatory model. If so, it wouldn’t be the worst outcome. The EU’s approach might be rigid and bureaucratic, as frustrated would-be Threads users can attest, and perhaps somewhat protectionist, but unlike China’s it’s not actually crippling international data flow.\\nIn that case, convergence would work better undertaken as a conscious co-ordinated effort by market democracies rather than an inefficient mishmash drifting unevenly towards the Brussels approach. If data protection and the digital economy is a global order of empires, it’s only just about holding together. An endless series of short-term fixes and workarounds is not a substitute for a system that’s stable, balances rights with freedoms and is grounded in international law.\\nalan.beattie@ft.com\\n', metadata={'query': 'Profile transfer features and user data management', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/919c778e-55ba-4bfc-af39-aa110fdb3810', 'title': 'The global order of digital empires is only just holding together', 'publication_time': '2023-07-19T15:49:27.095Z'}, uuid=UUID('c2e9ddf6-4fba-43f6-99e8-62b0068ca62e'), db_id=''),\n",

The Facebook owner hardly has a blameless record, and has been fined before over lax privacy protections, including $5bn by US regulators in 2019 over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Yet in this case Meta — like scores of other companies — is caught in a mismatch between EU and US law. The decision against it signals in effect that there is no functioning legal basis for Meta to do what it has been doing: transferring EU user data to the US. Unless a new attempt to create a framework to bridge the legal gap succeeds, the implications for tech firms, consumers and the internet are far-reaching.\\nThe crux is that EU law since 1995 has prohibited transfers of personal data to third countries unless they offer “adequate” levels of data protection. But the EU imposes much higher protections than the US, reinforced by its 2018 General Data Protection Regulation and a charter of fundamental rights . As the Snowden leaks of US intelligence a decade ago exposed, it is easier under US legislation for law enforcement agencies to access users’ data — and more difficult for consumers to seek redress.\\nThe European Court of Justice has struck down two successive EU-US frameworks designed to facilitate legal personal data transfer — Safe Harbor, and Privacy Shield — after challenges to Facebook’s practices by an Austrian privacy activist, Max Schrems.\\nThe court found US laws did not satisfy requirements that were “essentially equivalent” to those required under EU law. Facebook continued transfers on the basis of contractual clauses endorsed by the European Commission, though the ECJ also raised questions over these in 2020. After further complaints from Schrems, the Data Protection Commission in Ireland — home of Meta’s European HQ — found against the use of these clauses. It did not recommend a fine, but other European regulators overruled it in consultations.\\nMeta has been given five months to suspend data transfers to the US, and six months to stop any processing of EU citizens’ data previously sent there. Some European campaigners say regulators should have gone further and made it delete the data in the US. Meta plans to appeal against the ruling. Its big hope, along with other tech companies, is that a third EU-US data privacy framework set to come into force in the meantime will prove able to withstand legal challenges. Schrems says he may test it.\\nPresident Joe Biden signed an executive order last October that bolsters safeguards around US intelligence-gathering and creates a court for citizens to seek redress. Some EU experts are hopeful the new framework will meet the test of being essentially equivalent to EU standards. If not, either deeper reform of US intelligence laws or dilution of the EU’s GDPR would be needed, which seems politically untenable. Tempers already flared when the privacy shield was struck down in 2020, with a disgruntled US accusing the EU of hypocrisy given how some member states’ security agencies conduct themselves.\\nCompanies would otherwise be forced to store all EU personal data on EU servers, which they say could complicate or block all manner of activities from cross-border social networks to sharing clinical trial data. The EU rightly prides itself on world-leading standards on data privacy — a legitimate and growing consumer concern — while the US says it is protecting security activities from which allies also benefit. But the two sides need to find a way to ensure necessary personal data flows can continue legally.

       "  (Document(text='\\nThe editorial board\\nWhen a subsidiary of the world’s largest lender proposes to settle trades via a USB stick shuttled between New York trading floors by a runner, it ought to set alarm bells ringing. That was one contingency discussed last week when ICBC Financial Services — the financial services arm of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China — was hit by ransomware software, which prevented it from settling transactions in the $25tn US Treasury market. The hack was eventually contained by disconnecting its systems, alongside a $9bn capital injection.\\nWhile a larger fallout was avoided, the incident should act as a wake-up call for financial corporations and regulators to step up their efforts on cyber security. Such attacks were considered the greatest threat to the financial system, according to a recent Bank of England survey of UK market participants.\\nAs finance has become more digitised, the risks have grown. Attackers have also become more sophisticated. LockBit, the group suspected to be behind the ICBC FS breach, conducted recent assaults at Royal Mail and ION, a supplier of trading software to the City of London. Analysts also fear that the adoption of generative artificial intelligence may increase the pace, scale and effectiveness of attacks.\\nBanks and financial infrastructure are prime targets, and attacks come in several forms. Ransomware involves blocking access to data unless a ransom is paid. Other attacks aim to steal, leak or manipulate data, or simply cause disruption, for example by shutting down payment networks. The annual cost of cyber attacks — including theft, lost productivity and reputational harm — is estimated to reach $10.5tn globally by 2025.\\nBut in an interconnected financial system, attacks at one organisation also risk broader contagion. They can directly spark liquidity strains, bank runs and capital flight — which can be exacerbated by a loss of trust in financial institutions or payment systems. While breaches are more common at smaller organisations, the attack at a bank the size of ICBC FS is worrying.\\nMany financial institutions and jurisdictions have insufficient measures in place. More than 40 per cent of executives at America’s largest banks admitted their organisations may be ill-equipped to protect customer data and assets during an attack, according to a KPMG survey last year. Meanwhile, an IMF study found 56 per cent of central banks or supervisory authorities lacked a comprehensive financial cyber security strategy — just under one in two did not have specific regulations addressing cyber crime.\\nThe financial sector already invests significantly in cyber security, and monitoring initiatives are under way across the US and Europe. But as technological advances allow cyber criminals to raise their game too, mitigation efforts must be sped up. Three areas warrant particular attention.\\nFirst, global institutions need to strengthen their efforts on co-operation, to support better data-sharing and regulatory harmonisation. The financial system is only as strong as its weakest link, and emerging markets are particularly behind on security. Second, cyber risks need to be more embedded into assessments of financial stability, particularly via more comprehensive stress tests.\\nThird, while spending on deterrence and research on how new technologies can help to tackle cyber crime remains important, organisations need to ensure they have contingencies in place to deliver critical services in the event of a successful attack. This can help limit the spread of panic. Tougher scrutiny of supply chain exposures are also essential.\\nThe dust is now settling on last week’s chaos. It is a relief that a cyber breach at a prominent player in US Treasuries led only to rerouted trades and a slight impairing of liquidity. Next time, financial markets may not be so lucky.\\nLetter in response to this editorial: Why cyber security is so difficult to evaluate / From Rob Yau, Hong Kong', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/d3c7259c-0ea6-414b-9013-ac615b1a8177', 'title': 'The alarming cyber hack at ICBC', 'publication_time': '2023-11-14T18:10:34.603Z'}, uuid=UUID('5602ed0f-e720-4e33-90f3-586020609b12'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nPeter Barber\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nAre you ready to share your entire financial life online? It’s called ‘open banking’ and it just took a big step forward in the world’s biggest market.\\nLast month, US regulators announced measures to allow consumers’ financial data to be shared easily, following similar reforms in Europe and Australia that make it simpler to switch bank accounts and sign up for a range of financial products.\\nBanks “know every time you tap your card, they see you got the [train], and you go get your coffee, and you’re spending your money there,” points out Philip Benton, an analyst at tech research group Omdia and an expert on digital banking. “They [already] have all that data. [So] the whole point of open banking and finance is opening that up to the wider ecosystem.”\\nThat is being made possible in the US by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under a new Personal Financial Data Rights rule that will, for the first time, guarantee Americans access to their data held at a bank or other provider at no charge. As a result, customers will be able to share that data with third parties — which will be subject to limits on how they use it — or revoke access to the data at any time.\\n“With the right consumer protections in place, a shift towards open and decentralised banking can supercharge competition, improve financial products and services, and discourage junk fees,” argues CFPB Director Rohit Chopra.\\nThis right to control your data is one reason it is much simpler to change banks in, say, the UK, than in the US. “Account ownership is sticky in the US, where you are more likely to get divorced than to switch bank accounts,” observes John Pitts, the global head of policy for US fintech Plaid, and a former CFPB official.\\nSuch portability of personal data, says Pitts, would also allow consumers to pick and choose “different products that either their bank doesn’t offer or [does] offer but someone else offers a version that better matches your need”. A customer would be able to use those more suitable products without leaving their main bank.\\nCountries to watch 2023-2027\\nVietnam The success of local payment network NAPAS has boosted digital payments growth, with cardholders expected to more than double by 2027\\nAustralia The real-time payment network PayTo, launched last year, will see increasing adoption over next five years as new use cases emerge\\nSaudi Arabia Fintech is a key aspect of the country’s goal of payments among individuals to be 70 per cent digital by 2025\\nSingapore\\nThe city-state’s authorities have bold ambitions for a QR-code based payment system\\nSource: FT-Omdia Digital Economies Index\\nOpen banking began as a UK government initiative in 2018, as part of Europe-wide efforts to foster competition and innovation, and break the stranglehold of legacy providers on personal finance. The biggest British banks were forced to share their customers’ data with third parties such as fintechs for the first time, under the authorisation of those customers.\\nFive years in, the results vary. Progress in achieving the aims of Europe’s Payment Services Directive Two, which implemented open banking in the EU, has been “disparate”, according to Daniel Jones, a partner at law firm Orrick who specialises in technology and finance.\\n“There are many, many jurisdictions I think in the EU that aren’t meeting the expectations set by the law,” he says.\\nEven the country that started it all has gone only so far. Jones says that, in the UK, the reforms have only had an effect on bank accounts and credit cards. “We are yet to really unlock the potential, which is the ability to compare things like mortgages or pensions,” adds Jones.\\nWhat happens in the US is therefore being keenly watched. While there is already widespread use of fintech apps that make use of customers’ data from other financial firms, that information is often gathered through “screen-scraping”, whereby bots copy it from a website using the customer’s log-in details. This can be unreliable and carries risks, including having more data than necessary taken by the third party.\\nIn the US, the new open banking rule will require that, as in the UK, banks provide application programming interfaces (APIs), which allow data to be easily shared. The CFPB says its rule will “require data providers to establish and maintain a developer interface for third parties to access consumer-authorised data”.\\nIn the UK, the huge cost of implementing the technological changes fell solely on the big banks, and not on the fintechs who stood to benefit from access to their networks — which caused conflict.\\n“I’m aware of certain large deposit-taking banks that have spent over half a billion [pounds],” says Jones.\\nIn the US, the problem is that, while Wall St institutions can bear the costs, there are thousands of small and medium-sized providers that might struggle. The CFPB notes that “there are more than 9,000 banks and credit unions across the country, most of which serve as data providers, as do numerous non-depository financial institutions”. Making all those financial institutions work seamlessly together is likely to be a Herculean task.\\nAccording to the Fintech Brain Food newsletter, written by commentator Simon Taylor, the fact that the CFPB rule does not let banks charge for API access “will further reinforce the perception that open banking has zero upside for incumbents and all downside”. He proposes some form of revenue-sharing, in which banks could receive a small transaction fee when customers use open banking via third parties.\\nHowever, the Consumer Bankers Association, which represents retail banks, has welcomed the new rule, which also seeks to regulate fintech companies. “Many of these entities that are collecting, storing and selling this consumer information are not subject to the same rigorous data security and privacy standards as well-regulated and supervised financial institutions,” it pointed out.\\nAnd the Financial Technology Association — the fintechs’ lobby group — says the rule will bring consumers “one step closer to having a strong right to control their financial data”.\\nIn addition, the regulatory changes should bring the US closer to the wider vision of Open Finance: having your entire financial life — spanning your deposit account, pension, mortgage, insurance and share portfolio — instantly available in the one place, and easily portable to different providers. Benton notes that Australia started with this idea — an open data rule that would expand to cover everything.\\nBut steep barriers to fully Open Finance remain.\\nThe first is a “huge trust issue” between the traditional banks and the third parties, says Jones. One unanswered question is who is liable in the event of fraud or the loss of data. What is needed, says Jones, is either clear legislation or a “killer app”.\\nIn a recent Omdia survey on open banking, the top priorities of the banks were online security and protecting against fraud.\\nPitts agrees that the question of trust is key. “When I think about a bank, the image for me is a vault — and the vault conveys trust in a deeply meaningful way,” he says. “I think you need that same level of trust in open banking, and that means appropriate regulation and policies and procedures when it comes to fraud and privacy.”', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/e0203daa-1eca-46fd-a122-f6b4e5e29ec2', 'title': 'America embraces Open Banking', 'publication_time': '2023-11-07T05:30:12.112Z'}, uuid=UUID('b660fb5d-2d11-4ecc-9b8c-0f924fbbd8a6'), db_id=''),\n",

The regulator estimated this would capture about 17 companies accounting for 88 per cent of market share.\\nIt would apply to peer-to-peer platforms such as Venmo and Cash App, the official said, as well as cryptocurrency wallets.\\nThe proposal underlines a major shift in how banking services are provided in the US, with more and more consumers linking their bank accounts to digital wallets from companies such as Apple and Google.\\n“Payment systems are critical infrastructure for our economy.

The agency has said it is merely enforcing the law.\\nThe CFPB in 2021 requested big tech groups to turn over information on their payment systems including data harvesting, user choice and other consumer protections.\\nThe consumer watchdog is seeking to expand its authority even as federal agencies contend with the fallout from a US Supreme Court ruling that raised questions around their rulemaking powers.\\nAdditional reporting by Josh Franklin in New York', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/776adbc1-d4fc-4143-878b-717ddb92e4d9', 'title': 'US consumer finance regulator wants to extend oversight to Big Tech', 'publication_time': '2023-11-07T17:03:32.720Z'}, uuid=UUID('10c8a42a-7b8f-4e32-b00f-fcba20ee42d2'), db_id=''),\n",

The company collapsed in 2020 following the exposure of a massive fraud.\\n“From his home in Israel, Aviram Azari played a major role in orchestrating and facilitating an international hacking-for-hire spearphishing campaign,” said Damian Williams, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, whose office brought the case.\\n“Today’s sentencing sends an unmistakable message about my office’s firm commitment to prosecuting hackers, domestic and foreign alike.”\\nFederal prosecutors had alleged that between 2014 and 2019 Azari, of Kiryat Yam, was involved in an “extensive” conspiracy to target individuals and unnamed companies in New York using phishing emails in an attempt to steal passwords.\\nHis victims included “climate change activists and individuals and financial firms that had been a critical part of the German payment processing company Wirecard”, they said in a statement on Thursday.\\n“Some of the hacked documents that were stolen from various of the victims’ online accounts were leaked to the press,” the US attorney’s office said, which resulted in articles related to investigations carried out by attorneys-general in New York and Massachusetts about what ExxonMobil knew about climate change and “potential misstatements” from the oil group about the issue.\\nThe case related to a long-running federal investigation into an alleged Indian hacking group called BellTroX InfoTech Services, people familiar with the probe previously told the Financial Times.\\nThe extent of BellTroX’s alleged operations was described in a 2020 report by Citizen Lab, part of the University of Toronto’s Munk School. It said that “spear phishing” emails tied to more than 28,000 personalised web pages were created by hackers attempting to steal passwords from advocacy groups, journalists, elected officials, lawyers, hedge funds and companies. BellTroX has previously denied involvement in hacking.\\nA prolonged attack on Matthew Earl, a UK investor critical of Wirecard, helped Citizen Lab map the hacker’s shifting tactics. “\\u200b\\u200bEach day for three-plus years Aviram tried to hack me, undoubtedly at the behest of Wirecard,” Earl said at the time of Aviram’s guilty plea.\\nHedge funds, researchers and journalists at the FT and Reuters who wrote about Wirecard were also targeted by hackers with elaborate personalised emails.\\nAzari’s guilty plea in 2022 was this first successful prosecution following Wirecard’s collapse.\\xa0Former chief executive Markus Braun and two other former Wirecard executives have been appearing in a Munich court on charges of fraud, breach of trust, and market and accounting manipulation since last December.\\nIn addition to his prison term, Azari will serve three years of supervised release and will be forced to forfeit more than $4.8mn in illegal gains.\\nComments have not been enabled for this article.', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/5557859d-6eb8-4ccd-a78f-ec252f4e64ac', 'title': 'Wirecard hacker sentenced to 80 months in prison', 'publication_time': '2023-11-16T22:55:32.638Z'}, uuid=UUID('b97d5b8e-aa1e-41ee-9784-8362d97da040'), db_id=''),\n",

The incident could deliver a jolt to China’s sleepy cyber security industry.\\nThe attack was carried out using ransomware software developed by LockBit, the group behind attacks on targets including the Royal Mail and the City of London. The attacks paralyse computer systems until a payment is made.\\nRansom payments are not the only cost. These attacks breach client records, giving hackers access to confidential information and transaction history. Costs of remediation and reputational damage can be high. The average cost of a ransomware attack was $5.1mn this year, according to IBM. That was up 13 per cent from a year ago.\\nThere is a real risk that the adoption of generative artificial intelligence will increase the pace, scale and effectiveness of cyber attacks. The production of convincingly personalised emails will make phishing attacks more dangerous.\\nTime, then, for China’s cyber-security technology industry to play a more prominent role. It has long been overshadowed by the country’s focus on growing its homemade chips and AI sectors.

       "  (Document(text='\\nNikou Asgari\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nIt’s been a sobering month for crypto. King of the nerds Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all charges relating to the rapid rise and fall of FTX and is likely to face decades in prison. His arrest for running the biggest corporate fraud in US history has shaken crypto bros out of their Wild West behaviours and forced them to clamour for regulation and transparency.\\nBut one corner of the crypto industry isn’t ready to straighten up.\\nCrypto ATMs are a niche but still growing area, despite whack-a-mole efforts by regulators to shut them down for being the ideal way to launder money . Operators say they help ordinary people convert fiat (real) money into and out of their crypto wallets, much like a normal cash point does with a normal bank account.\\nOne operator of machines across Europe, the aptly named Shitcoins Club, says it helps people in “bypassing the banking system”. To better understand their business model we contacted Shitcoins Club, but were told: “our company’s focus and client base do not align well with the interests of your readership, which primarily represents the traditional fiat-based financial system.” Ouch.\\nCrypto ATMs have long caught the eye of regulators in the US and UK including the Financial Conduct Authority, which earlier this year pursued its “continued crackdown on this illicit sector” by shutting a bunch of them down .\\nThough the number of ATMs has dropped since 2022 highs, new machines are still being installed. As of October this year, 32,521 crypto ATMs exist globally, with the number rising since the summer, according to data provider AltIndex.\\nShitcoins Club says on its website :\\nWe are opposed to the fractional reserve banking and the participation of banks in the ever-increasing fiat money supply. As anarcho-capitalists, we despise what is commonly understood by the financial system. Our contempt goes far - reaching even the bank staff.\\nThis anti-banking, stick-it-to-the-man philosophy might take some people back to the early days of crypto, when traders saw blockchain money as a revolution and an escape from the tight grip of major banks on global finance. It hasn’t quite worked out that way . Nevertheless, the crypto ATM crowd purports to remain steadfast in their beliefs.\\nSometimes they don’t even need the cash machine. Bitgamo, which claims it is based in Luxembourg,* runs a virtual crypto ATM where users can convert tokens to cash in the click of a few online buttons. No KYC, AML or registration required, the website boasts . And if you live in a country where regulators don’t like crypto? Simply tick the box and Bitgamo helpfully says “money will be sent from Offshore Bank Account which will not be related to Cryptocurrency.”\\nForget decentralisation, distributed ledger technologies and other shiny words, let’s stick to good old-fashioned offshore accounting to evade laws and possibly also sanctions!\\nGabriel Weber, director of communications at Bitgamo, was refreshingly forthright about his company’s approach: “The law here in Luxembourg is a bit different than other countries. We’re not forced by the authorities to request KYC from the client.”\\nAnd if the cash being converted to crypto comes from drug trafficking, people smuggling or\\xa0arms dealing ?\\n“We are not here to investigate, it’s not our job, our job is to exchange. As long as there isn’t a court order we cannot cooperate with any authorities,” Weber said.\\nAnd that anti-banking philosophy again: “What Satoshi [thought] when he created bitcoin is no longer what happens today. Crypto is about privacy, we support Satoshi’s idea. We are focusing to support privacy.”\\nBitgamo plans to launch about 90 physical ATMs next year, Weber said, adding that business is booming , with more than 50mn daily transactions. And that so-called crypto winter? Please. “We are still hiring, we are expanding.”\\nBut that might not last for long. Luxembourg’s Financial Sector Supervisory Commission told us they’ve issued a fraud warning about the company, saying no business called Bitgamo is registered with the agency.\\n*This and the paragraph above were added once we were alerted to the Luxembourg authorities finding no record of Bitgamo being registered in the country.\\nFurther reading: — The rise of crypto laundries: how criminals cash out of bitcoin (FT)', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/e627c64f-fe63-4963-8ed4-e58f25cbd32b', 'title': 'The crypto ATM business is somehow still booming', 'publication_time': '2023-11-08T06:00:57.514Z'}, uuid=UUID('cfedb63c-622c-45cf-b2f2-74cac9999903'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nLaura Noonan\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nAs much as many of us value human interaction, there are some tasks that artificial intelligence performs much better than any person. Verifying customer identity is one of them, according to online finance specialists.\\nAs anyone who has ever opened a bank account online or in the flesh knows, a document with your photo will almost universally be required as proof of identity.\\nIn a bank branch, a clerk will look at you and your passport or driving licence, for example, to see if they match. Or, if you apply online, you’ll be asked to take a picture of the identity document and your face, which will then be read by a machine. And the technology will probably be more accurate in analysing the images than the bank employee.\\n“Humans are not particularly great at recognising humans,” explains Yuelin Li, chief product officer at UK-based digital identity verification provider Onfido She points to studies showing that machines are better than ordinary people at recognising faces and just as good as “professional facial examiners”, who are more likely to be employed in law enforcement than by banks.\\nRecommended\\nThere are many reasons for machines’ superiority in facial recognition. Li says humans can struggle with reconciling how someone looks currently with ID card photos that could be years old, and matching a 3D image of a real person to a 2D one. Machines are more precise because they can use measurements of, for example, the distance between facial features and the size of marks to figure out if the person and the photo match.\\nMachines are also much more experienced than even the most skilled bank clerk. Li says Onfido uses a machine-learning model, which improves the accuracy of the technology powering its system over time. It can also, at the request of clients, check whether someone has previously tried to link the same face to a different name.\\nOnfido also offers verification using other documents, such as utility bills. It looks at the document to verify an address, checks if there is a valid issue date, and whether the template looks reasonable. Fundamentally, though, the advice the company gives to financial institutions is that the use of records such as utility bills is not the most secure way to verify someone’s identity.\\nLi says online customer onboarding — taking a client on to a banking or investment platform and setting them up — is more secure than more traditional approaches because it is now typically done entirely within a bank or payment provider app. “One of the things people are very nervous about is [using] things like call centres,” she says. “A lot of attacks that are going on now — a phishing attack or a text message or something — they [criminals] get you because you’re coming out of the app.”\\nThat helps explain why online verification has become mainstream in recent years, with Li noting that the “vast majority” of onboarding is now online, among the traditional and new institutions that Onfido works with in the UK.\\nRevolut, a UK fintech that doesn’t have physical branches, has more than 30mn online customers worldwide. Its head of financial crime and fraud, Aaron Elliott-Gross, says the company uses a combination of internal models and systems alongside services from vendors to deal with the “constant threat” of, for example, AI-generated images and deep fakes being passed off as ‘selfie’ videos of real people.\\n“They [the vendors] check to make sure the selfie is live, they check to make sure there’s motion, and the vendors are very good at this. We provide an additional layer [of checks] on top of this because we see so many onboards that we think we have something to add\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009to see if there’s anything we can detect that’s unusual.”\\nElliott-Gross stresses that facial recognition and verifying documents such as bills are the “basic building blocks” but that much more sophisticated checks happen behind the scenes. “It’s really what you do beyond that differentiates you\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009It’s very obvious [to the potential new customer] that we’re verifying documents, it’s very obvious that we’re verifying data,” he says. “We run a lot of modelling on top of that.\\n“[We] say, let’s not just look at the data a customer gave us, let’s look at other signals we have about that customer — say [what the] IP address on their mobile device looks like, the history we have on their phone number or email address [which Revolut can get from data providers] to figure out whether that customer is a genuine onboard or fraudulent.”\\nRevolut is also using its identity tools for more than onboarding. For example, it can verify that people still have control of their accounts if they switch phones or if they are make an unusually large payment. This ensures that, if a phone is stolen, the thief won’t then be able to execute a large transaction from the victim’s account.\\nThe fintech is also “very interested” in the evolving field of behavioural biometrics , which involves profiling, for example, the angle at which a user typically holds a device, and the speed at which they press its buttons or type. All these idiosyncrasies can help to authenticate identity once the user has been onboarded.', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/2c5291ae-2f31-439d-8176-a669a88d41e0', 'title': 'Why is technology best for checking bank customer identities?', 'publication_time': '2023-10-23T04:00:44.501Z'}, uuid=UUID('2fdce5b8-f1b2-4674-8999-504330eced73'), db_id=''),\n",

This fact is not, in itself, especially exciting.\\nWhat is noteworthy is that Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, spoke and gave a set of recommendations for regulators’ future approach to payments policy.\\nOne of these ideas — in an area where the CFPB has direct authority — hints at big potential changes in the way crypto platforms will need to deal with hacks.\\nThere’s lots of content in the full speech, which starts around 1hr19min into the broadcast of the Brookings event . The policy recommendations are transcribed below, so our commenters can give it a close read. Feel free to scroll ahead if the suspense is too great, though, as we will focus only on the bolded section today:\\n.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009we think a number of steps are warranted.\\n- First, the CFPB will be issuing supplemental orders to certain large technology firms to acquire more information that will help us better ascertain their specific business practices and plans, especially with respect to the use of personal data and any issuance of private currency.\\n- Second, to reduce the harms of errors, hacks and unauthorised transfers, the CFPB is exploring providing additional guidance to market participants to answer their questions regarding the applicability of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act with respect to private digital dollars and other virtual currencies.\\n- Third, the CFPB is going to look at\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009supervisory examinations of nonbanks offering consumer payment platforms. We have a number of authorities to do so, such as when these firms serve as service providers to large depository institutions. Another one of these authorities includes defining larger participants in this market by rule, which would subject banks meeting a particular size threshold to CFPB supervision.\\n- Fourth, as suggested in the November 2021 report, the Financial Stability Oversight Council should consider exercising its authority under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act to designate this activity as, or as likely to become, a systemically important payment clearing or settlement activity. This could provide for example other agencies with critical oversight and tools to ensure that a stablecoin is actually stable.\\n- Finally, it’s critically important for American consumers to have stronger protections against excessive surveillance and misuse of our data. Later this month, I will authorise the publication of a proposed rule regarding personal financial data rights. This is pursuant to section 1033 of the consumer financial protection act. The rule will seek to accelerate America’s shift to open, competitive and decentralised banking while also seeking to safeguard against abuse of our personal data.\\nYes, the CFPB is thinking over how the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, or EFTA, might apply to crypto accounts.\\nThe EFTA is meant to protect consumers from payments fraud. Institutions that facilitate electronic fund transfers are required to notify customers of whether, or when, they will be liable for unauthorised transfers (ie fraud) . The liability disclosures are supposed to happen before an account’s first transfer takes place , according to CFPB rules.\\nInteresting! We wonder how many of those disclosures were sent by platforms like Axie Infinity before it and its users ( specifically its Ronin bridge ) got mega-hacked . Or crypto.com . Or FTX, whose big hack got a little overshadowed by, you know, everything else.\\nNotably, a platform doesn’t need to disclose its customers’ liability if it doesn’t impose any .\\nEarlier this year, an opinion from SDNY Judge Denise Cote said cryptocurrencies should be considered “funds” , meaning that the EFTA should apply to crypto platforms. Adam Levitin covered this at the time for CreditSlips :\\n.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009if you have a crypto account with an exchange, it would seem to be an “account” at a “financial institution” that is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes and is used for electronic transfers of “funds.” In fact, I had just emailed Bob Lawless for a sanity check on this, when I came across a very recent SDNY decision that held that the EFTA applies to crypto.\\nThat’s a huge consumer protection win. Reg E has important consumer protections regarding unauthorized transactions , error resolution , and provision of receipts and periodic statements . It also creates huge compliance headaches for crypto exchanges, which are not set up for dealing with any of those problems.\\nIn light of that ruling, today’s comments about EFTA from CFPB Director Chopra seem even more newsworthy.

She also recommends the following checks:\\nFirewall configuration Configure network firewalls to block unnecessary incoming and outgoing traffic, allowing only essential communication;\\nEndpoint protection Install endpoint protection solutions, such as antivirus and anti-malware software, on all devices;\\nPassword management tools Use password management tools to generate strong, unique passwords and store them securely.\\nOther solutions companies should consider include “intrusion detection and prevention systems” (IDPS), “security information and event management” (SIEM), secure email gateways, and web filtering.\\nIn this new hybrid working era, companies are increasingly transitioning from “virtual private networks” (VPNs) to “zero trust network access” (ZTNA). ZTNA assumes all connection requests are hostile, enabling companies to create tailored authentication policies for granting secure access.\\n“Alongside its large security benefits, many companies have also found ZTNA to be a good replacement for their ‘wide area network’ (WAN),” says Marion Stewart, chief executive of managed security service provider Red Helix. “It connects straight to the desired location instead of going through the corporate firewall and slowing down the user experience.”\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) can now be used to identify threats quickly and efficiently — and free up your security team.\\n“The volume of threats facing organisations, and the novelty of attack methods, has grown exponentially in recent years, making it extremely difficult for human security teams to monitor, detect and react to every threat or attempted attack,” warns Hanah-Marie Darley, director of threat research at cyber security group Darktrace. “Today, thousands of organisations entrust AI to interrupt in-progress, sophisticated attacks without trying to rely on humans to take the sledgehammer out and interrupt wider business operations in the incident response process.”\\nShe says AI-powered solutions can be powerful in dealing with novel threats — such as never-before-seen attacks that might slip past traditional security controls.\\nEven with these technical solutions, companies can forget the human aspect of securing a business. But it is essential to develop a security mindset in the workforce.\\nCate Pye, partner and cyber expert at PA Consulting, says companies need to engage individuals and give them pride in the fact they are looking after people’s data — and make it easier for them to do the right thing, or harder to do the wrong thing. She cites the example of an email system that pops up a vignette of a news story about a cyber attack if an employee tries to click an external link. This forces employees to check before clicking. “It makes you delay, and think slower — you have gone out of ‘automatic’ mode,” says Pye.\\nCompanies must also close loopholes when employees leave. A 2022 survey by security provider Beyond Identity found that nearly one-third of employers suffered a website hack due to ineffective offboarding of staff. “One of the biggest vulnerabilities is an account of an employee that’s left, and it hasn’t been disabled,” says Asam Malik, partner and head of technology and digital consulting at consultancy Mazars.\\nSome cyber countermeasures can be implemented at no cost at all. These include creating a cyber incident response plan , conducting attack risk assessments on key third party suppliers, and simply changing complex passwords regularly.\\nThen there are the cyber defences you do not realise you already have. For example, many organisations use Microsoft Office 365 software for their daily tasks but are unaware it has security features, such as password management and MFA, included — they just need to be switched on.\\n“They’re not expensive,” says Malik. “But, even if they were, they’re never going to be as expensive as a breach to your company.”', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/d1d9aaab-edbf-4ca2-a90b-bc9332f73dd4', 'title': 'Five easy wins in cyber security', 'publication_time': '2023-09-21T03:00:33.104Z'}, uuid=UUID('8771baa6-8044-4736-8633-85599bcb347a'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nCarly Minsky\\nIn 2001, software company Oracle began marketing a new database product with the claim that its cyber security was “unbreakable”. Within days, researchers had found vulnerabilities to hacking .\\nAt the time, Oracle tried to double down on its security message but, today, more than 20 years later, consumers have become as sceptical about companies’ security claims as cyber professionals. Less than a quarter of consumers in the UK, for example, are confident that businesses adequately secure their personal information, according to research carried out last year by the Information System Audit and Control Association (Isaca).\\nData security has rapidly made its way into the public consciousness, with the growth of social media platforms and the introduction of new rules, such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU. But, despite the drop in customer confidence, data consultant Caroline Carruthers — who became one of the UK’s first chief data officers when she took the position at National Rail — believes this increased consumer engagement results in more informed decisions.\\nIt also makes consumer businesses place more value on cyber security. “Boards genuinely understand that cyber security is either a competitive advantage or something that can cause them real harm if they get it wrong,” Carruthers says.\\nWhere, once, companies treated cyber security like insurance — a necessary outlay on something they hoped never to use — they now recognise it as an opportunity for business growth, says Chris Cooper, a chief information security officer who works for consultancy Fractional Execs. “There is value in promoting your cyber security to consumers,” he argues. “Transparency between the consumer and the business is key to digital trust.”\\nFinancial services was one of the first sectors to focus on cyber security in its advertising — in part to reassure customers as apps and digital services replaced in-person visits to branches. For example, in 2017, HSBC’s “The Secret Den” TV ad promoted its voice-activated security. However, now the emphasis is on cyber security education, says Paul McGuigan, strategy director at brand consultancy ThreeTenSeven. He cites a campaign from challenger bank N26 in which normal people — like a club bouncer and a fisherman — explain cyber security concepts.\\nBut Mark Rampton, head of cyber security at Starling Bank, does not believe cyber security should be used as a sales tactic. “We care about our security because our customers deserve nothing less — it’s not a marketing and media push,” he says. “Our main content focus is practical advice for customers to protect themselves from scams.”\\nIn the health sector, marketing campaigns about data protection and usage tend to serve a very different purpose to sales-focused advertising, says McGuigan. For many healthcare services, the priority — and the challenge — is to increase consumer trust by clearly communicating why personal information is essential for healthcare services to collect and use.\\nRecommended\\n“Generally, there’s a lack of understanding that, to keep moving forward at pace, healthcare and medical science need to access and share data — for purposes like research and joined-up care,” he says. “There are safeguards in place, but they are poorly understood and therefore untrusted by the public.”\\nHe thinks healthcare has been less proactive and strategic in telling a compelling story about the benefits of allowing personal data to be used — an approach that has been shown to reduce consumer anxiety about security.\\nSome companies are now trying to share best practice on health data sharing. In the US, when the Roe vs Wade ruling permitting abortions was overturned in 2022, female health app Flo Health launched Anonymous Mode — allowing users to report health data in a way that is not connected with any personal information they shared when signing up. Rather than treating the feature as a selling point, Flo has since open-sourced the technology to encourage other health apps to adopt the same practice.\\n“Privacy, security and data protection standards should be a focus for all wellness apps,” argues Sue Khan, data protection officer at Flo Health. “We believe that when women’s health products compete on privacy and security, the user loses.”\\nWhen women’s health products compete on privacy and security, the user loses\\nUsers need to be able to assess a company’s cyber security credentials — the question is how this can be done, says Matt Eustace, data protection officer at data insights company Aiimi. Certifications, such as the UK’s Cyber Essentials Plus, are helpful, but unfamiliar to consumers.\\n“To help consumers make informed purchases with information security in mind, we need a system which evidences cyber security credentials in a more accessible way,” Eustace says.\\nHe suggests a simple 1-5 scoring system could be universally adopted — an idea similar to the “green-amber-red” system that Carruthers says she put forward for the UK government’s National Data Strategy.\\nCyber professionals believe it is better if companies disclose their security credentials — even if it makes them a target for ego-oriented hackers.\\n“You don’t want to say you have ‘unbreakable security’ because all security is fallible,” says Quentyn Taylor, director of information security at Canon Europe. “But I don’t think there are any disadvantages to being open and honest that you are confident in your cyber security — as long as you have an incident plan in place.”', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/93f23e86-7103-4b3e-88a6-af61280588e8', 'title': 'Consumer groups put more value on security', 'publication_time': '2023-09-21T03:00:33.085Z'}, uuid=UUID('fbf8e482-1366-4975-af60-c0b1ac04b894'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nNick Huber\\nWithin just a few decades, the commercial aviation industry has gone from using computers only for flight bookings to operating an end-to-end digital air travel journey across multiple connected systems. Ticketing, passports, payment information, even airport security processes are linked — but these technological advances create security vulnerabilities.\\nIn 2022, there were 38 “successful” cyber attacks on the aviation industry, according to KonBriefing Research.\\nThen, in April this year, pro-Russian hackers claimed responsibility for a five-day attack on Europe’s air traffic control authority — disrupting its website but not European aviation.\\nThese attacks have become possible because aviation technology is now a “sea of complexity”, says Frank Dickson, a cyber security analyst at IDC, a research company.\\n“You took a system that was incredibly secure and connected it — [which creates] an attack surface,” he says. “It’s surprising that it hasn’t had more significant cyber security breaches.”\\nRecommended\\nHow, then, does the industry protect itself and customers from cyber attacks? Is disconnecting an option?\\nMost experts doubt whether a large-scale disconnecting of systems to the internet, or from each other, is feasible, given the disruption this would probably cause passengers. In fact, the direction of travel is towards more automation and technology.\\nHowever, some airports and airlines — including American Airlines and Spain’s Iberia — have begun exploring new techniques, such as encrypted, single-use digital tokens and facial recognition technology, to verify passengers’ identity. These technologies aim to make journeys through airports faster and more secure and, post-pandemic, with less physical contact. Aviation is “moving to a more digital version of identity management”, says Philippe Vallée, executive vice-president of digital identity and security at Thales, a technology company that supplies the aviation industry.\\nNevertheless, airlines and airports still take a twin-track approach, with manual safety precautions. Alexander Döhne, cyber security manager at Germany’s Frankfurt airport, says that, if there is a cyber threat or attack, all its internet-facing systems could be disconnected with a fallback to emergency processes. The airport could use paper lists and telephones to get relevant airline information, he points out.\\nBut the airport is also looking to the future and testing the use of artificial intelligence. Whether it is applied to detect cyber risks, or whether cyber criminals try to use it to attack airports, “AI will have a huge impact,” predicts Döhne.\\nFor their part, airlines argue that their cyber security is strong due to an industry regulatory culture that has always prioritised safety. Best practice includes “air gapping”, in which an IT system or network has no physical or wireless connection to the internet or other systems, and “redundancy”: multiple back-up systems for critical IT functions.\\nThe aircraft they use have been “subject to 40 to 50 years of design culture regulations”, notes Matthew Vaughan, director of aviation security and cyber at the International Air Transport Association (Iata), the airline trade association. “[It’s] near perfect in terms of IT-related interference today.”\\nYou took a system that was incredibly secure and connected it — [which creates] an attack surface\\nEven if a passenger aircraft’s wireless internet connection or in-flight entertainment system were hacked, there is no overlap between these systems and critical IT systems, Vaughan says. “They are physically separate.”\\nStill, some experts argue that ageing operational systems and fragmented supply chains leave multiple cyber security risks.\\nComputer and ground control systems that communicate with aircraft can be up to 30 to 40 years old, says Patrick Kiley, an information security expert at Mandiant, a cyber security company owned by Google. As a result, they have not been designed with today’s security threats in mind, which can make them less secure than modern systems.\\nPilots also use tablet devices to check the data for each flight — for example, passenger numbers, flight distance and fuel requirements — and any interface connecting “very rapidly evolving technology with a piece of very old technology” can be a security risk, Kiley warns.\\nHowever, updating or replacing old aviation computer systems can be tricky.\\n“Upgrading legacy systems that are constantly in use is like changing the tire on a car while you’re driving it,” says Eric Escobar, principal consultant at Secureworks, a cyber security company.\\nFor many operators, it will have to be done. Governments and regulators are now legislating to raise security standards in aviation.\\nIn March, the US government issued updated cyber security requirements for airports and airlines — including having a plan to improve “cyber security resilience” and measures to prevent unauthorised access to “critical” cyber systems. Last year, in Europe, requirements were strengthened for several industries, including aviation.\\nBut whatever the regulatory and security challenges of an increasingly digitised aviation system, few experts expect that disconnecting it would improve security.\\n“The train has left the station,” says IDC’s Dickson. “Imagine the cost of a move to paper-based tickets\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009digital transformation is here to stay.”', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/0d6f67b2-65f3-43b4-91ae-d9186a2dd274', 'title': 'Airlines prioritise safe connections', 'publication_time': '2023-09-21T03:00:33.123Z'}, uuid=UUID('fb415412-b039-46a1-979c-5f4962388b3f'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nAlan Livsey\\nAmerica’s power and reach depends not just on what you can see, from military hardware to the software of social media, but on that which lies out of sight. Take the unseen network of fibre and wires that the US employs to weaponise its financial system against both enemies and allies.\\nThat, at least, is the claim of foreign policy specialists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman, whose book, Underground Empire, tells the tale of America’s efforts to control the world economy by seeking out and manipulating a subterranean communications network of “tunnels and conduits”. Some of this effort is intentional, some happens by chance. In the words of the authors, by taking charge of key intersections of the network, “the US government could secretly listen to what adversaries were saying to each other or freeze them out of the global financial system”.\\nThat story is captivating — the stuff of thrillers. Their thesis that this work continues today as part of a secret and elaborate system, less so.\\nThe authors begin with the financier Walter Wriston and the borderless, almost stateless hopes he had for finance. As he rose to the top of one of the world’s largest banks, Citicorp, where he was chief executive from 1967-1984, Wriston helped create the offshore eurodollar market, away from US bank regulation, and the less memorable MARTI (Machine-Readable Telegraphic Input).\\nOther banks understandably chose to sidestep Citicorp’s efforts to monopolise a digital messaging system for transactions. European institutions formed their own correspondence system with the snappier name of Swift (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications).\\nMARTI disappeared as Swift’s encrypted format won over the world’s banks, including all important US ones. Some 11,000 banks use it in 200 countries, apart from North Korea. Even one of Russia’s largest banks, Gazprombank, remains on it.\\nA key accelerator for Swift and other systems that enable speed of light movement of capital around the world was the internet. The early development and adoption of the internet primarily occurred within US borders, a point not lost on the country’s national security agencies.\\nFarrell and Newman, political scientists from Johns Hopkins SAIS and Georgetown University respectively, reveal how much US government agencies — in the name of national security — have strived to undo the efforts of Wriston and others to create a libertarian financial network. He had hoped to build a world where business rather than government ran the show.\\nTracking the path of profits raised through criminal activities led to money laundering charges against Asian and European banks\\nAny hope of that scenario succeeding conclusively ended with the 9/11 terrorist attack on America. Counter-terrorism and America’s national security became paramount, and more hidden than ever. Security agencies began to drink from the water hose of data flowing through the internet.\\nThe US had the bulk of the world’s internet data traffic coursing through these arteries. When Edward Snowden leaked secret National Security Agency documents in 2013, he revealed Stormbrew, an NSA map with eight key US internet exchanges around the country, including in San Francisco. These were network choke points which the NSA had discovered over time. The NSA used these to tap data, from friends or foes, while seeking any potential threats to the US.\\nThe authors show how the success of America’s security agencies to track data encouraged law enforcement officials to use similar methods, particularly against foreign banks. Tracking the path of profits raised through criminal activities led to money laundering charges against Asian and European banks. Once a foreign bank committed any offence under US laws within the American financial system, they became fair game.\\nFarrell and Newman tell the tale of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), caught in the sticky web of the US Department of Justice in a 2012 money laundering case. Its eventual settlement with the DoJ later led the bank to divulge information about a Chinese client, telecommunications equipment supplier Huawei.\\nHere the authors do a very good job detailing the arm-twisting tactics of US agencies. These led to the arrest and detention of Huawei’s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou and daughter of its founder Ren Zhengfei in Canada. The story of how America used its own data networks is one Farrell and Newman tell very well.\\nUnfortunately the authors stretch the underground empire metaphor so thinly that by late in the book it has nearly vanished. It doesn’t help that as early as page 60 they tell the reader that the combination of increased encryption and rerouting of fibre optic networks means that the “United States is less central than it used to be”.\\nToday, it is not just conspiracy theorists worrying about data security, but every country and company. That has provoked a natural response to avoid dealing in the US dollar, not just by China and Russia, but by America’s allies as well.\\nNo doubt America has weaponised its economic power. The idea that its power still lies hidden within underground networks of financial and other data is not a convincing thesis.\\nUnderground Empire: How America Weaponized the World Economy by Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman Allen Lane £25, 288 pages\\nAlan Livsey is Lex research editor\\nJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Café\\n', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/d00426ad-19d9-4e0f-be75-93c6b6a8cc64', 'title': 'Underground Empire — how America uses its data networks to control the global economy', 'publication_time': '2023-09-18T12:00:25.773Z'}, uuid=UUID('24c9e248-480b-4a86-b30b-cba4b61acff6'), db_id=''),\n",

But the presence of so many employee details on underground forums underlines the risk that large corporations like MGM face from the varied and constantly evolving methods that hackers use to gain access to networks.\\n“For such large and profitable companies like MGM and Caesars, they would have had the resources available to protect their data and customers,” said Andrew Martin, chief executive at Dynarisk. “They could have done things to prevent this breach that were relatively simple, including if they had been monitoring for these credentials being stolen and acted [promptly], the whole thing could have been prevented.”\\nThe login and passwords in the data set were probably stolen from a computer infected with a malware called Redline , according to Dynarisk, which hides behind pirated copies of video games or other software. The MGM IT employee’s password for his company login was “K@sper99!” and a Caesars IT employee’s was “W@lmart1”.\\nRedline also steals and packages freshly stolen cookies, the tiny pieces of information that browsers use to identify frequent visitors to websites so that users do not have to enter their login details repeatedly.\\nA person claiming to represent a hacking group nicknamed Scattered Spider told the Financial Times on Thursday that it had carried out the breach at MGM, including trying to tamper with the casino resort’s slot machines.\\nThe group is allegedly behind at least 100 attacks on major US corporations and is considered a major threat to western companies.\\nIts members, mostly English-speaking hackers from the US and Europe, are known to impersonate an employee they have studied over social media in phone calls to company help desks where they try to generate fresh passwords.\\nIn this instance, the person claiming to represent Scattered Spider said it had also compromised an employee’s phone number, allowing it to reroute a text message containing a one time password to the hackers, instead of the employee.\\nThe stolen passwords and logins were for a system called Okta, made by the eponymous identity management company based in San Francisco, whose software is used by thousands of businesses to verify their employees’ identity before granting access to internal company websites.\\nA dark web site tied to a group that Scattered Spider has sometimes worked with said on Friday that “MGM made the hasty decision to shut down each and every one of their Okta servers after learning we had been lurking on their Okta servers”.\\n“Although we cannot speak to the MGM event, we have seen social engineering attacks involving a threat actor calling an organisation’s help desk, impersonating an employee, and persuading the help desk to reset multi-factor authentication for a highly privileged account,” said a spokesperson for Okta, referring to the accounts of either senior employees at companies, or people working in the IT departments whose accounts would have greater access to the rest of the companies’ networks.\\nDynarisk’s Martin said more companies were at risk — other data sets he had seen traded recently included credentials for employees at more than 500 other companies, including those at Wells Fargo, WPP, Experian, Diageo, Wayfair, Epic Games and Adobe.\\n“More of these hacks are coming,” he said.', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/3428d3b3-7283-4650-bd5d-2120b52f70cd', 'title': 'MGM and Caesars employees’ logins ‘hacked and traded’ on cybercriminal forums', 'publication_time': '2023-09-15T12:21:31.983Z'}, uuid=UUID('004885e5-f798-4075-a443-70887d55eca4'), db_id=''),\n",

Borrow from customers at, say, 2 or 3 per cent and lend out at 5 or 6 per cent. Capture the spread as profit.\\nUS regulators believe that bank executives are too easily seduced by that simple calculus.\\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has therefore proposed new rules. One requires regional banks with more than $100bn of assets to issue a minimum amount of long-term debt, equivalent to 6 per cent of their risk-weighted assets.\\nThe agency believes boosting these balance sheet liabilities — swapping flighty deposits for stickier debt securities — will reduce the risk of bank failures. It should also limit the watchdog’s costs for bailing out depositors. That was necessary earlier this year at Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic.\\nIt is a reasonable proposal. The risk is one that market forces already police. With deposit capital electronically mobile, banks must pay up to attract it. Banks might as well pay a bit more to get the benefits of long-term bonds. These are safe from redemption by smartphone or customers visiting branches.\\nAccording to analysts at Jefferies, the 17 regional banks they cover collectively have $216bn in long-term borrowings. Those institutions would need to raise another $6bn of debt to meet the new requirements (several already have sufficient). The impact upon earnings per share would be just 1 per cent, netting out coupon payments against reinvestment of cash raised.\\nAn additional layer of debt capital would theoretically impose losses upon sophisticated private sector investors should the banks run into trouble.

But the pronouncement could equally have related to India’s growing confidence in the vanguard of financial innovation.\\nFor years, Modi has pursued policies to push an overhaul of a financial system that not long ago was both old-fashioned and predominantly cash-based, as well as chaotic. This made fraud, bribery and tax evasion easy and endemic.\\nHis 2016 decision to withdraw high-value notes from circulation with virtually no notice was contentious and caused huge disruption for many months. But combined with the development of a universal digital identity system (Aadhaar), and a push to develop a real-time digital finance architecture (UPI or Unified Payments Interface) on the back of it, there is little question that India’s financial system has been transformed.\\nA PwC report a couple of years after the demonetisation initiative concluded that both the number of taxpayers and direct tax collections had grown significantly, by 10 per cent and 19 per cent respectively. Instant payments of the kind facilitated by the low-cost UPI network have exploded. According to ACI Worldwide , India processed nearly 90bn transactions last year, more than anywhere in the world, and up 77 per cent on the year before. That dwarfs the likes of the US (2.8bn) and China (17.6bn). (On a per head basis, it ranks seventh, beating most developed countries, including the UK.)\\nThe Aadhaar identity system that has provided the foundation for the UPI rollout has been criticised for further marginalising a minority of Indians. But 1.3bn Indians, including 99 per cent of adults, are now part of it. Dilip Asbe , who heads the National Payments Corporation, the organisation behind UPI, reckons 350mn people now use the system for payments, a number that should continue to expand as smartphone usage and 5G networks proliferate and services are extended to encompass credit and investments as well as payments.\\nTo address those left behind, particularly in rural areas, India this month revealed an initiative to allow the processing of voice-based transactions. In areas with no or little internet connectivity, phone-to-phone transfers would be a viable alternative.\\nThe UPI system has international potential too. Already real-time transfers using the network are feasible with Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates should create a similar link-up in the coming months, according to Asbe. Links to overseas locations where Indians live or travel could transform the efficiency and cost of remittances to family back home as well as boosting the tourism economy.\\nAll this is only one leg of India’s digital finance transformation. The country has also been exploring the potential of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). This initiative that has been boosted by broader world events — the rise of China and Beijing’s ambitions for the renminbi; the challenge posed by upstart cryptocurrencies; and, perhaps, most of all by the weaponisation of the dollar and the global payment system by the US and its western allies as a means of punishing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\\nIndia is among the most advanced with its CBDC project. A pilot began late last year and has since been expanded to involve 13 banks in 26 locations, compared with four banks in four cities initially. Some experts believe a digital rupee might fully launch as soon as next year. The pilot project has involved integrating it with the UPI system, so that merchants can accept digital rupee payments using the same QR code they already have for UPI transactions.\\nReformers believe a digital rupee offers a big opportunity to enhance the efficiency of both retail and wholesale payments. The international potential is significant, too, if the central bank can agree bilateral or multilateral swap arrangements with counterparts abroad.\\nAt last week’s Brics summit, Brazil president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was pushing a new Brics currency. Even his fellow heads of state did not echo that call and no one expects the dollar to be undermined any time soon as the lingua franca of global money.

       "  (Document(text='\\nScott Chipolina in London\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nIf you’re a central banker, the advent of crypto has elicited two reactions. The first is concern. Private companies could begin to have considerable sway over the supply of money, by minting millions of tokens, without any oversight from you.\\nOr they insert themselves in financial markets, into investors’ portfolios, and somewhere down the line it ends up with you doing the unthinkable: an intervention in markets that is tantamount to a bailout for people of questionable integrity or motivations.\\nThe second reaction is more open-minded: acknowledging that money is always changing and the arrival of computers is having profound consequences for society.\\nIn many societies, the use of cash is already declining and payments are being made by contactless cards and phones. But finance and technology tend towards the creation of large monopolies that prevent new entrants from making serious inroads into a market.\\nThe central banker may realise the need to harness the technology not only for the bank’s own policy purposes but to keep the payments system open to competition.\\nThese drivers have meant virtually every central bank in the world has begun exploring the possibilities of issuing their own digital currency. Generally speaking, it would work much like the money does now — used to make payments and transfers and held as a store of wealth in a digital form.\\nBut because it is issued directly by the central bank and not a commercial bank, the settlement is instant and is risk-free credit. It would be managed and tracked on a distributed ledger, a shared register of deals but limited to fewer approved actors.\\nThe nearest thing the crypto industry has to this is a stablecoin, but the crucial difference — aside from the lack of a token to incentivise trading and speculation — is that the central bank currency is truly backed by sovereign money. A sum of £100 really is £100 and there are no questions that need to be asked over the reserves backing it.\\n“Electronic money at the moment is only as good as the promise of the commercial bank that’s issuing it; it’s not central bank money,” said Ross Buckley, a professor at UNSW Sydney’s law faculty.\\nChina is probably the country most ahead in its efforts to push ahead with a central bank digital currency (CBDC), but this week Russia tried to catch up with the launch of a test pilot phase of its own digital currency.\\nIt is starting with 13 banks testing the digital currency on real customers — involving 600 people and 30 companies from 11 cities. Next year, the central bank hopes to include more banks. Another 19 have expressed an interest.\\nThe early plans are to test basic transactions, including person-to-person digital rouble transfers, before rolling out QR code-based payments and business-to-business transfers.\\n“The whole idea behind this is to try and enter this very new market of digital currencies and not to lag behind,” said Sofya Donets, Renaissance Capital’s chief economist for Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. “The reality of digital assets has been frightening to central banks for three to five years now.”\\nBut this is Russia, whose economy and currency are straining under the weight of the Ukraine war and the sanctions imposed on it by the US, EU and UK. Inevitably some within Russia have portrayed the digital rouble as a way to escape the bans. The western commercial banks and market operators are the main institutions responsible for sanctions compliance.\\n“The digital rouble really takes us to a different level in terms of our payment technologies in the country as a whole, and enables us to build cross-border payments with the countries that are also set to issue national digital currencies,” Olga Skorobogatova, Bank of Russia’s first deputy governor, said at a press conference last week. But it’s hard to see how this stands up. The sanctions are designed to stop the flow of hard currencies such as dollars and euros flowing into Russia and to cut off individuals’ access to the western financial system. Payments in Russia are unaffected, nor are payments that exchange roubles for other currencies such as the renminbi or rupee.\\nA rouble is still a rouble, digital or otherwise. This week, it touched 100 to the dollar, sparking an emergency meeting and interest rate rise from the central bank and talk of currency controls. As Vladimir Milov, a former deputy energy minister, told my colleagues this week, “no one wants roubles”.\\nLike many a crypto innovation, it leaves one asking what it does that existing payments system (if they’re modern) can’t already do. The one thing a CBDC does is leave an electronic trail.\\nAnd already in Russia, the digital rouble has stoked fears that the financial privacy of its users is at risk — a final irony for a payments system inspired by technology that once set itself up as an anonymous alternative.\\nA survey for Russian Forbes at the start of August found more than 65 per cent of 1,250 companies polled did not see the benefit of a digital rouble, 15 per cent worried about state control of the currency and only 3 per cent thought it would simplify cross-border payments in the face of sanctions. A special thanks to my colleague Daria Mosolova for translations.\\nThe Bank of Russia did not directly respond to a request for comment about concerns surrounding financial privacy, but it has previously tried to dispel concerns.\\nHowever, even then some wonder if privacy is any stronger in the current financial system. “The level of financial privacy in Russia is already low,” said one former Bank of Russia employee. “We are moving in this direction already but a digital rouble doesn’t have to be part of that shift\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009it’s costly to create a CBDC [and] if your goal is removing financial privacy, you can just pass laws to do that for free,” the person said.\\nWhat’s your take on Russia’s foray into CBDC territory?

       "  (Document(text='\\nWhile Eswar Prasad is right to highlight concern that retail central bank digital currencies could be used for “surveillance purposes” ( Opinion , July 25), there are three key ways in which central banks can mitigate the privacy risks associated with CBDCs.\\nFirst, central banks must maintain a design framework that upholds data anonymity. Although CBDC would be a liability of the central bank, it doesn’t follow that the central bank would have access to user data. Under an intermediated model, for example, customers would hold accounts or wallets managed by private providers, with data protection in line with existing banking solutions or better.\\nSecond, central banks should examine novel technology solutions to allow CBDC users to enjoy as much “cash-like” privacy as possible. The public should have absolute confidence that their data is confidential. Technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs and secure enclaves can technically enforce privacy while protecting system integrity.\\nFinally, the central bank must first and foremost embrace its responsibility to service citizens in its design of CBDC. It is not beholden to shareholders but to us, the people. This is an opportunity for a best-in-class solution that sets the standard for all payment offerings for years to come.\\nThe ability to hold cash and spend it without authorisation is an important source of personal privacy, so it’s entirely natural for people to be wary of new technologies digitising this type of money. Open collaboration between central banks, regulators and technology providers across both the public and private sectors will be key in fostering the necessary consumer trust to make this transition credible.\\nJack Fletcher Head of Policy and Government Relations for Digital Currencies, R3 London EC2Y, UK', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/e6c02398-78ce-44c8-990a-3eeb95d53b64', 'title': 'Letter: Central banks should ease fears over CBDC privacy', 'publication_time': '2023-07-27T23:00:31.245Z'}, uuid=UUID('aebe1bfd-a252-4a1e-81bf-4dffcc23c41a'), db_id=''),\n",

Since the law was passed third-party apps that are linked to an individual’s bank account have proliferated, without clear rules on how information should be best shared.\\nThe information can be shared through an API (application-programming interface) that allows two websites to easily communicate with each other. But “screen scraping” — where consumers share their bank log-in details for bots to copy their financial information, a practice that regulators have taken a dim view of — is also still used in the US.\\nThe CFPB’s rules will compel banks to put in place systems that will facilitate consumer access to their financial data such as transaction history, account balances and payments details. The CFPB said it was requiring this data be made available for free, and that it hoped these rules would deter the use of screen scraping.\\nThe issue of whether banks could charge a fee to third parties for data sharing had been an area of contention.

       "  (Document(text='\\nMichael Peel in London\\nThe quest to shield the world’s digital data from attacks by next-generation quantum computers is about to pass a critical milestone, as US authorities unveil a suite of protection tools.\\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology is poised to publish three approved security algorithms that governments and companies can use to safeguard information from the emerging threat of quantum hacking.\\nNist’s action is part of a gathering revolution in cryptography in response to fears that quantum computers will one day be able to crack codes protecting sensitive data that have for decades proved unbreakable by less powerful traditional machines. Encrypted data is essential to the functioning of modern societies in the digital age — and keeping it secure is essential to individuals, companies and governments.\\nWhile industries such as finance and telecoms are planning intensely for the transition, other potentially vulnerable businesses have made few or no preparations.\\n“It will be massive and expensive,” Dustin Moody, leader of Nist’s post-quantum cryptography standardisation process, said of the looming security change.\\n“We need new solutions that will provide protections from attacks from these future quantum computers. So much of our security and what we do online — financial transactions, medical information — all of that is protected cryptographically.”\\nNist, part of the US commerce department, is awaiting sign-off of the trio of standards, which it put out for comment last year. The algorithms are part of wider Nist preparations for the era of post-quantum cryptography, involving input from leading tech companies, banks and other businesses and researchers.\\nUS federal agencies will be required to use the new algorithms. While there is no obligation on private companies to do the same, many organisations in the US and elsewhere have in the past followed Nist’s lead on cryptography.\\nQuantum computers have revolutionary potential because of their extra power to crunch numbers. While standard machines use binary bits that exist either in one of the states 0 or 1, the “qubits” of their quantum counterparts can be in both states simultaneously. This means they can do some tasks — such as searching for ways to unlock long-standing data protection methods — exponentially quicker.\\nQuantum computers are still far from commercialisation because their qubits only hold their quantum states for very short periods, introducing errors, or “noise”, into calculations.\\nUS mathematician Peter Shor showed 30 years ago on a theoretical level that quantum computers with a sufficient number of stable qubits could crack the maths problems underlying traditional cryptography. Such machines do not exist yet — but technological advances raise the prospect that this critical moment, known as Q-day, could one day be reached.\\nNist’s work is at the forefront of preparations for Q-day. It received submissions from researchers in more than 30 countries on six continents, reflecting a common interest in combating cyberterrorism and extortion. Scientists from China have participated in the Nist process, though Beijing is also thought to be working on its own cryptography rules for the quantum computing era.\\nThe Nist standards would be “something of a catalyst for people to leap into action”, said Lory Thorpe, an IBM executive who works with clients on quantum safety.\\n“For some industries this isn’t something that enterprises do by themselves,” Thorpe said. “So its going to require a level of co-ordination, particularly around the standards.”\\nSome businesses have already started to move, while others may be more likely to consider a move after seeing the impact of last month’s global IT outage . In February, Apple declared it had secured its iMessage system with a “groundbreaking post-quantum cryptographic protocol”.\\nBy contrast, other industries — and many smaller companies — are less advanced. Businesses dealing with supply chain logistics are among those that most need to focus on the change, observers say.\\nOne difficulty in encouraging the shift to new cryptographic methods is that there is no specific deadline attached to the quantum computing threat. It may at first glance appear less pressing than previous time-specific IT hazards, such as the “millennium bug”.\\nYet experts say the menace is already here. Hackers are able to take a “harvest now, decrypt later” approach, meaning they can steal data today and then store it until the quantum computing technology that can crack it is developed.\\nRecommended\\nThe publication of the Nist standards will further fuel debate about the best types of next-generation cryptography. While the new algorithms use classical computer methods of encryption, some researchers are developing ways to harness the awesome power of quantum mechanics as a defensive tool.\\nThis idea, known as quantum key distribution, exploits a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement. This refers to the way that the characteristics of two subatomic particles can be related, even if they are separated by a vast distance. By measuring data from one particle, you can infer information from the other, allowing the pair to serve as keys to exchange coded messages.\\nA big advantage of the technique is that if someone attempts to eavesdrop such communications, the disruption to the system will warn the two parties they are being spied on.\\nOn the other hand, the technology has an important potential security downside. While the quantum element of the communication is secure, the equipment used to transmit and relay it is not.\\nExperts say next-generation cryptography will probably involve a mixture of classical and quantum techniques, according to which best fits uses and users. The quantum key distribution method is likely to be suited to parties that trust each other, communicate often and have tight control over the physical infrastructure they use.\\nThe finalisation of Nist’s algorithms will be a defining moment in global preparations for cryptography’s new era. It should trigger a response from people who have so far “stood on the sidelines”, said Luke Ibbetson, head of research and development at UK telecoms company Vodafone.\\n“Even among people who are aware of the threat, they have been reticent to take action until we have published standards from people like Nist,” said Ibbetson, who is working on cryptography with other telecoms businesses from Europe, the US and Asia. “So it will be a little bit like firing the starting pistol.”', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/f602b685-8226-42b4-9336-e488c63c37bf', 'title': 'US nears milestone in race to prevent quantum hacking', 'publication_time': '2024-08-06T04:00:02.189Z'}, uuid=UUID('d7bb8551-5d37-46c9-ae67-f1dc11aa9c78'), db_id=''),\n",

I live in New York, which is about 1,000 miles from where Evolve Bank is based. I have one bank account, jointly with my wife, that we opened in person at a New York City branch of one of the nation’s largest banks nearly two decades ago. We have one bank credit card account.\\nAnother email arrived with a picture of a $480 cheque made out to my wife. I have confirmed that this is legit, a payout that Copper, a fintech that had partnered with Evolve, believes we are owed — money missing from my non-existent, at least to my knowledge, account.\\nThis is modern finance, or perhaps an indictment of it. How my personal data was stolen from a bank that I never was a client of and how my wife ended up with nearly $500 that I don’t think is hers is evidence of how interconnected and messy and vulnerable our current banking system is.\\nThe small Arkansas bank’s troubles started in April when Synapse, a fintech, went bankrupt. Synapse wasn’t a typical fintech, offering say loans or savings accounts online. Instead, it specialised in connecting other fintechs to traditional banks, often small community lenders, in pass through relationships that are sometimes called rent-a-bank. The small banks want more customers but need a way to reach them. The start-ups have sleek apps, but no safe place to keep their clients’ funds. For dozens of apps and a handful of banks, Synapse became the matchmaker.\\nSynapse claimed that as many as 10mn accounts were managed through its platform. Much of the cash was deposited at Evolve Bank. That trove of client information made Evolve a prime target. Earlier this year, the Russian backed hacking group LockBit 3.0. claimed to have hacked the bank’s systems. Even though Evolve’s most recent regulatory filing says that it has just over 280,000 accounts, the bank says the hack exposed the customers’ names, bank info and social security numbers of as many as 7.6mn individuals.\\nEven before the hack was known, though, Synapse went bankrupt and turned off its systems. That left the fintechs with clients, but no money, and the banks with cash, but unreliable knowledge of whose it was.\\nWorse, Synapse’s court appointed receiver, Jelena McWilliams, who was the head of the regulator Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the Trump administration, has said there is a gap between balances that the fintechs say their clients are owed and what Evolve and other banks say they were holding for Synapse. McWilliams says the shortfall between the two could be as large as $95mn.\\nThat left most of the accounts frozen for weeks. Recently, Evolve and another bank been able to recruit some former Synapse employees to help the banks retrieve data that would identify who owns the accounts. Some of the money has started flowing back to customers, though it’s still not clear how much is missing.\\nI am still not exactly sure how my family and I get caught up in this. Synapse worked with dozens of fintechs, including Copper, which provided debit cards aimed at teens that my family used. In May, shortly after Synapse went bankrupt, Copper turned off my kids’ debit cards, and closed my family’s account. The company said it was no longer offering the product. We got an email saying there was $93 remaining in our Copper account, which we received in a few days.\\nA spokeswoman for Copper told me that the company had closed all of its accounts connected to Evolve long before Synapse went bankrupt, and that the company has not been notified by Evolve that any of the accounts Copper had at the bank had been breached.\\nA customer service representative at Evolve confirmed the data breach letter I received was real, but that, unlike what was said in it, I didn’t actually have an account at Evolve Bank. She said my information was likely passed to Evolve by one of the fintechs it worked with, but couldn’t say which one. As for the $480, my guess is that it is a small piece of the millions of dollars that have gone missing, but I can’t be sure. The lack of clarity on all of this is perhaps evidence that the much hyped world of fintech, and the banks that are willing to partner to them, need to pay a little more attention to its plumbing.\\nstephen.gandel@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/5723165e-c964-470b-b7e9-8b018683f22c', 'title': 'How I got ‘hacked’ and what that says about the banking system', 'publication_time': '2024-08-03T04:00:13.520Z'}, uuid=UUID('657b6340-e672-4a0e-9ba2-c91518b00f05'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nClaer Barrett\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nThe UK experienced a £6mn spike in cash withdrawals from ATMs on Friday last week when the global cyber outage disrupted digital payments, exposing the vulnerabilities of the transition to becoming a cashless society.\\nThe inconvenience of being unable to use card or contactless payments may well have caused you to gnash your teeth. However, this problem is experienced daily by millions of UK adults who use cash. Last year there was an unexpected 66 per cent increase in the number of people mainly using cash for everyday spending; the first rise in four years.\\nThese figures were revealed by banking trade body UK Finance in the same week that the Financial Conduct Authority set out how it will maintain access to cash in the future. This may provide some respite for the poorest and oldest consumers who tend to be the most reliant on cash, but their lack of access to online banking and other digital services is a far bigger problem to solve.\\n“The key message is we’re not ready to go cashless until digital payments are completely\\xa0robust and reliable, and accessible to everyone in a way that meets their needs,” says Adrian Roberts, deputy chief executive of Link, which runs the UK’s cash machine network.\\nAs traditional bank branches vanish, with 6,000 lost in the past nine years, the regulator is relying on shared banking hubs to plug the gaps, with 100 expected to be open by the end of this year, and plans for 250 more. These guarantee access to cash withdrawal and deposit facilities, but new legislation stops short of mandating access to other banking services — hence a wider problem of digital exclusion emerges.\\nAccording to UK Finance, 60 per cent of all adults used mobile banking in 2023. Or to put it another way, 40 per cent did not.\\nBanking hubs enable face-to-face contact with different high street lenders, but customers have been frustrated by the limited services. Sensitivity about the security of IT connections means some community bankers are unable to access customer data on their laptops, instead relying on customers to bring in their own devices.\\nYet managing your money online costs money. You’ll need to pay for a smartphone or tablet capable of running your bank’s app. “Data poverty” is another issue; only 5 per cent of eligible customers use social tariffs — cheaper mobile and broadband packages available to customers claiming benefits.\\nFactor in the 13mn Britons with very low digital capability, half of whom are over 70, and this helps explain why the poorest in society are stuck with cash — it’s not necessarily an active choice.\\nNatalie Ceeney, chair of Cash Access UK, says banks are voluntarily working together to overcome IT issues and provide a commonality of hub services. However, being digitally excluded affects your ability to manage your finances, and your life, in many other ways.\\nFor one, you are less able to save money by shopping around online for better deals on all kinds of goods and services, including on different credit products. You are also excluded from innovations in digital payments. Last year, one in seven people in Britain used buy now, pay later to split the cost of one large payment into several interest-free monthly instalments. Used responsibly, this can be a lifeline for those on tight budgets who lack the creditworthiness to borrow elsewhere.\\nThen there’s access to public services. State benefits such as universal credit are “digital by default”; undoubtedly one factor behind the estimated £7.5bn that goes unclaimed each year. Phone helplines have a habit of being chronically understaffed. HM Revenue & Customs wants to “make tax digital” but taxpayers who needed to phone spent the equivalent of 800 years on hold in the 2022-23 tax year.\\nLast week’s cyber outage caused chaos in the UK’s healthcare system. Most GP surgeries have prioritised digital appointment booking systems over phone lines, and they also offer patients a convenient method of obtaining test results and repeat prescriptions. Yet again, the digitally excluded must make do with a lesser system.\\nWhen my smartphone was stolen recently, I realised how much I took digital connectivity for granted. I couldn’t order a cab, check emails on the move or find out if the Central Line was working.\\nTrivial problems maybe, but the profound way this altered my ability to go about everyday life was a powerful insight. The educational and economic disadvantages for those who lack the skills or means to navigate our increasingly digital world are much more serious.\\nThings may be getting back to normal after the CrowdStrike debacle. But for millions of UK adults, the digital outage continues.\\nClaer Barrett is the FT’s consumer editor; claer.barrett@ft.com ; X @Claerb ; Instagram @Claerb\\nLetter in response to this article:\\nCash-using colossus dreads the idea it might disappear / From Tim Davies, Cardiff, UK', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1cecf172-ee7b-434d-bf0f-fc84c5faf155', 'title': 'Access to cash is the tip of a digital iceberg', 'publication_time': '2024-07-27T04:00:51.593Z'}, uuid=UUID('2e15225e-10ef-455c-a0d7-2e1a4464cc76'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nNicholas Fearn\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nMigrating banks’ old technology to cloud computing systems is creating a cyber security nightmare for their IT and risk teams, experts have warned.\\nCloud infrastructure — which enables software and data to be held off-site and accessed by any part of an organisation, in any location — is helping the world’s banks develop digital services with greater ease and speed.\\nBut experts warn that cloud adoption can also be highly risky for banks and financial groups, because cyber criminals are increasingly exploiting security “holes” and misconfigured settings in cloud platforms to steal data, defraud customers and disrupt operations.\\nWith so much sensitive financial and personal information stored in the cloud, as digital banking has become widely adopted, data breaches have become a leading concern for financial groups, says Simon Crocker, senior director of systems engineering for western Europe at cyber security company Palo Alto Networks.\\nCyber criminals’ approach is to access data by identifying vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in the cloud services used by banks, he explains. But the damage does not stop there; criminals can also take over customer accounts, commit financial fraud and access other banking resources, he adds.\\n“One of the key threats banks face when securing their cloud environment is attackers gaining unauthorised access through their inbound traffic, such as a customer’s online banking transactions or account opening, or outbound traffic, which includes activities such as payment processing, trading and interbank communication,” Crocker explains.\\nHe says hackers can intercept banking traffic by launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which overwhelm computer servers with large volumes of requests, as well as SQL (structured query language) injection and cross-site scripting attacks, which inject malicious code into applications and websites.\\nMoving to cloud systems is, therefore, a trade-off in terms of risk, Crocker argues. “Ultimately, banks rely on cloud service providers to deliver secure and reliable infrastructure and services,” he says. “However, vulnerabilities in cloud platforms, misconfigurations, or security weaknesses in the underlying infrastructure can expose banks to significant security risks.”\\nVulnerabilities in cloud platforms, misconfigurations, or security weaknesses in the underlying infrastructure can expose banks to significant security risks\\nBanks’ best options for mitigating these is using encrypted communication methods, such as virtual private networks, dedicated private connections and web proxy servers, Crocker advises. In addition, he recommends using network segmentation — whereby computer networks are separated into smaller parts — to limit the impact of security breaches and improve control over outbound traffic flows.\\nA bigger challenge, however, is dealing with unknown, or unaddressed, security flaws that bank IT teams have not prepared for — known as “zero-day” exploits .\\n“‘Zero-day’ describes recently discovered security vulnerabilities that hackers can use to attack systems, and literally means that an organisation under attack has ‘zero days’ to fix it,” explains Sergey Lozhkin, principal security researcher at Russian antivirus software company Kaspersky, and former vice-president of cyber security operations for JPMorgan Chase. He warns that these can give cyber criminals a strong foothold in cloud banking systems.\\nAdvanced persistent threats, or APTs, are attacks that can also go undetected, giving hackers a big advantage. “APTs\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009exploit vulnerabilities to gain prolonged access to a bank’s cloud infrastructure, allowing them to exfiltrate sensitive data over time,” says Lozhkin.\\nWhile both types of attack present significant cyber security risks, the sophisticated nature of APTs is forcing banks to step up their defences. Lozhkin points out that APT hacking techniques were instrumental in the 2016 cyber attack on South Africa’s Standard Bank Group, when cybercriminals stole $13mn by forging 1,600 cards.\\xa0“APTs are like a stealthy burglar that can sit within networks completely unseen for any length of time before striking,” he says.\\nTo mitigate zero-day exploits, Lozhkin recommends the use of advanced monitoring solutions to detect “unusual activities indicative of a zero-day attack”. Automated tools can also “streamline this process” and decrease “the window of opportunity for attackers”, he adds.\\nAnd, to mitigate APTs, he suggests threat detection solutions, network traffic analysis, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, which provide continuous cyber security monitoring and user behaviour analytics (UBA).\\nLozkhin is confident this approach will work. “By implementing a comprehensive security strategy that includes regular updates, configuration management, advanced threat detection and robust incident response plans, banks can mitigate the risks posed by zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats, protecting their assets and maintaining customer trust in an increasingly digital world,” he says.\\nHowever, Jake Moore, UK-based global cyber security adviser at Bratislava-headquartered security company ESET, fears many institutions are not taking action quickly enough. “The banking industry has been slow to adopt cloud security and this has been made slower due to the tough regulations the industry faces,” he says. “Ransomware attacks, which now commonly include data-compromising techniques, pose one of the most significant risks to financial institutions.”\\nRansomware attacks, which now commonly include data-compromising techniques, pose one of the most significant risks to financial institutions\\nAccording to Moore, implementing a “multi-layered security approach” will help banks mitigate these risks. These layers should include stringent authentication protocols — such as physical security keys, unique passwords and device identifiers — to prevent unauthorised persons from accessing cloud systems.\\nRegular security audits will also help IT teams find and fix vulnerabilities in cloud-based banking systems, he suggests, while strong encryption can make sensitive data unreadable, even if it is stolen by cyber criminals.\\nBut, with human error being the cause of most cloud security breaches, according to a report by defence group Thales , Moore urges banks to train their staff in tackling cyber threats.\\nMany can be mitigated using zero-trust models, says Tristan Morgan, managing director of security at telecoms group BT. These demand that everyone trying to use a bank’s WiFi network, whether employee or customer, is “constantly checked and validated”.\\n“It also provides visibility of who is on the network, reducing risks, and supporting the operational needs of companies in a hybrid working environment,” says Morgan.\\nBernie Wright, chief information security officer at cloud infrastructure provider ClearBank, advises banks to operate a “comprehensive supplier onboarding process”, to eradicate security risks in their supply chains. He notes that many suppliers offer software-as-a-service products (licensed on a subscription basis) that are run in the cloud and, if improperly secured, can provide hackers with backdoor access to banking clients’ IT environments.\\n“There are certain levels of trust that are needed so, as part of due diligence, it’s crucial to review how suppliers operate, their associated corporate policies, and resilience capabilities,” Wright emphasises.\\nHowever, far greater cloud computing applications — and threats — are expected to arise in coming years from quantum computers. These devices harness quantum mechanics to carry out vastly more, and faster, processing operations than today’s computers could ever manage.\\nKamran Ikram, senior managing director in financial services at the UK and Ireland arm of consultants Accenture, sees both pros and cons. “Banks can build more resilient and secure financial systems with quantum algorithms constructed to find opportunities for credit scoring and optimising trading trajectories,” he says. “But quantum computing will also allow encryption codes to be cracked in a fraction of the time they now take.”', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/2b36a642-bda5-4e43-9747-2175c4d72fd0', 'title': 'Banks moving into the cloud prompt forecasts of security risk', 'publication_time': '2024-05-02T04:00:12.100Z'}, uuid=UUID('2584e622-f08e-4897-9f27-14999c6b711f'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nNick Huber\\nArtificial intelligence technology is presenting new risks — and new opportunities — to financial institutions hoping to improve their cyber security and reduce fraud.\\nBanks and financial services groups have had to grapple with cyber attacks for decades, as their financial assets and huge customer databases make them prime targets for hackers.\\nNow, though, they are up against criminals using generative AI — which can trained on images and videos of real customers or executives, to produce audio and video clips impersonating them. These have the potential to fool cyber security systems, experts warn. According to a report by identity verification platform Sumsub, the number of “deepfake” incidents in the financial technology sector increased by 700 per cent in 2023 , year on year.\\nAt the same time, criminal gangs are using generative AI technologies to spread malicious software, or malware. In one experiment, cyber security researchers used an AI large language model (LLM) to develop a benign form of malware that can collect personal information, such as usernames, passwords and credit card numbers. By constantly changing its code, the malware was able to evade IT security systems, the researchers found.\\nTo counter the threat, financial services companies — which are among the biggest spenders on technology — are deploying AI in their cyber defences. For at least a decade now, banks have been using different types of AI, such as machine learning , to detect fraud by spotting patterns in transactions and flagging anomalies.\\nThe difficulty lies in keeping up with cyber criminals who have access to the latest AI tools. Many banks are struggling to do so, according to a report published in March by the US Treasury department. It concluded that finance companies should consider greater use of AI to counter tech-savvy cyber criminals, and share more information about AI security threats.\\nDeploying AI in this way, however, could create other risks. One concern is that criminals could attempt to inject false data into the LLMs that underpin the generative AI systems, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, used by financial services companies.\\n“If the attacker injects normal [finance] transactions as fraudulent, or vice versa, then the [AI] model would learn to classify these activities incorrectly,” warns Andrew Schwartz, senior analyst at Celent, a consultancy specialising in financial services.\\nRecommended\\nSome financial services companies, however, are pressing on with generative AI systems. In February, Mastercard, the payments technology company, previewed its own generative AI software , which it said can help banks better detect fraud. This software, which analyses transactions on the Mastercard network, will be able to scan 1tn data points to predict whether a transaction is genuine.\\nMastercard says the technology might be able increase banks’ fraud detection rates by, on average, 20 per cent and, in some cases, by as much as 300 per cent.\\nAI-enhanced transaction monitoring can deliver another big benefit: a more than 85 per cent reduction in the “false positives” reported, according to Mastercard. These are instances where a bank mistakenly flags a legitimate transaction as a fraudulent one. Mastercard plans to make the AI feature commercially available later this year.\\n“[Our AI] is really helping to give a better experience to consumers, while still accurately detecting the right frauds,” says Johan Gerber, Mastercard’s executive vice-president of cyber security and innovation.\\nOther cyber security functions, such as analysing threats in real time and coordinating swifter action against them, can be automated, too.\\nFor example, Irish company FBD Insurance uses AI-based security software from Smarttech247 to analyse up to 15,000 IT “events” per second on its network for potential security threats. Such events could include an employee accessing prohibited IT or email systems, or firewall breaches.\\n“A big change in our AI is that we’re interpreting and inspecting things as they happen,” says Enda Kyne, chief technology and operations officer at FBD. Traditional cyber security technology takes longer to spot threats, doing so “after the fact”, he explains.\\nExperts stress, however, that AI-powered cyber defences will not replace financial groups’ IT and risk management professionals in the foreseeable future. Emerging flaws in generative AI — such as the fabrication of facts, or “hallucination” — means the technology still needs careful oversight.\\nAttackers are going to use AI more and more. And you simply can’t combat the scale of activity without using AI yourself\\nYashin Ahmed, who leads cyber security services in financial services at tech group IBM, has mixed views on finance companies’ use of AI for cyber security. Although AI can create “tremendous efficiencies” for information security, he adds that financial services companies are “struggling” to keep track of the growth in its use.\\n“They don’t know all the places where the business is necessarily using the AI,” he points out. “And they don’t know if the business has secured the AI during the development process and if the business has tools in place to secure the AI once it’s deployed in a customer-facing type role.”\\nRecruiting staff with the right mix of AI and cyber skills can help to minimise the unintended consequences. But finding staff can be challenging, given a decade-plus global shortage of cyber security staff and intense competition for AI experts from large tech companies.\\nA “very small” number of candidates “have the level of understanding and experience” financial services companies want, says Giancarlo Hirsch, managing director at Glocomms, a technology recruiter. “So it’s a much nicher candidate pool.”\\nDemand for AI-enhanced cyber security is also likely to boost sales of off-the-shelf software. The global market for AI cyber security products and services is forecast to grow from about $24bn in 2023 to nearly $134bn by 2030, according to data provider Statista.\\n“Attackers are going to use AI more and more in upcoming years,” says Rom Eliahou, director of business development at BlueVoyant, a cyber security company. “And you simply can’t combat the scale of activity without using AI and machine learning yourself.

An example would be a cyber criminal phoning a victim and using verifiable information to make the call seem convincing, such as pretending to be a banking adviser.\\n“This faux authentication can quickly let a target’s guard down, effectively handing the attacker the keys to their castle,” says Moore. “Impressive manipulation tactics are constantly improving and can often leave people stunned at how easily they were influenced.”\\nBut Moore says zero-trust security models, which promote the principle of never trusting and always verifying users, can “force people to do their due diligence and further checks to prove verification”.\\nMaya Prabhu, managing director and head of wealth advisory for Europe Middle East and Africa at JPMorgan Private Bank, advises wealthy family offices to create a list of policies to strengthen their online security.\\nThis can include steps such as regularly changing passwords, refraining from sharing personal information with AI programs such as ChatGPT and using virtual private networks when connecting to public WiFi networks, she explains.\\n“There is also merit in including guidance on who to call and what action to take should any online issues arise, to ensure a quick resolution and minimise any possible impact on the family’s wealth,” she adds.\\nConsidering that many youngsters now own smartphones, tablets and other gadgets, Prabhu believes wealthy families should instil good cyber hygiene in their children.\\n“The conversation should begin with the basics for younger children, such as not using their birthday as a password and not purchasing things without permission, but should evolve into a more in-depth conversation around safety and rules as they grow up,” she says.\\nKevin Barrett, managing director of private and commercial banking at Arbuthnot Latham, recommends wealthy individuals regularly monitor their online accounts, limit sensitive information access and perform regular data backups to “fortify their defences against online threats and ensure the security of their wealth and personal information”.\\n“The more money you have, the more of a target you become,” he concludes. “And we regularly advise clients to remain vigilant against potential threats of financial fraud, identity theft, ransomware attacks, data breaches, physical security threats, espionage, insider threats, reputational damage, and extortion.”\\n', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/169179ed-cc1f-467c-be1c-6668781604d6', 'title': 'Wealthy urged to improve digital hygiene in fight against cyber crime', 'publication_time': '2024-03-22T09:05:20.099Z'}, uuid=UUID('e81c19cb-8364-4e96-96c5-3ea9c2ccf2f8'), db_id=''),\n",

But they say that the current proposals would leave the risks related to the suspended accounts on their balance sheets even after the funds were transferred to the government, said people familiar with the matter.\\nThis would be a “double liability” for banks, said one.\\n“There isn’t anyone at the moment that would be willing to take on that risk,” said another, who added that banks see the proposals as unworkable. They said the scheme amounted to asking banks to make “donations” to the government because accounting rules meant lenders would still be unable to unlock the suspended assets.\\nAccountants have been called in to try to resolve the impasse, said two people familiar with the matter. But one added that no easy solution has been identified.\\nBanks must suspend accounts or transactions that they suspect involve criminal funds. But many accounts are suspended indefinitely because authorities neither authorise the bank to unfreeze the account or investigate the case fully.\\nThe new scheme, which would be voluntary for lenders, would cover bank accounts that have been suspended for at least seven years and would apply where the owner had not come forward, which often happens in economic crime cases.\\nBanks’ objections centre on ministers’ insistence that liabilities relating to the transferred funds would remain with the financial institution rather than passing to the government as happens with similar schemes, such as one for dormant accounts.\\nUnlike dormant accounts, suspensions follow a proactive decision by a lender and it is “not practical” for the government to take on liability for potentially unfair suspensions or adjudicate on customer complaints, said a person familiar with officials’ thinking.\\nThe Home Office plans to pay banks a rebate if a customer later makes a claim to recover funds that have been transferred to the government, but these reimbursements would be subject to a cap.\\n“At present, the proposals for the release of these funds do not come with a proportionate level of risk transfer, due to issues with liability and accounting treatment,” said Aminah Samad, director of financial crime at UK Finance. Banks would continue to work with the government in search of a solution, she added.\\nThe Criminal Justice Bill is at report stage in the Commons but much of the detail will be set out later in regulations.\\nAlex Norris, Labour’s shadow Home Office minister, said he backed the principle of a suspended accounts scheme to channel “money obtained by illicit means to good use”.\\nBut he added: “The government have given strong undertakings that they have secured the buy-in of our financial institutions. Once again it seems reality doesn’t match the press releases.”\\nNorris argued that a Labour government would work with financial institutions to implement a “workable” scheme as soon as possible.\\nThe Home Office said: “Criminals should never benefit from the proceeds of crime.”\\nIt added that it was “committed to developing a scheme that works for industry, whilst protecting the rights of innocent customers” and would “continue to work closely with the financial sector and technical accounting experts” on the details.', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/6a0aa766-7298-42b4-a1f4-93326aafd070', 'title': 'Banks clash with UK government over plans for funds linked to criminality', 'publication_time': '2024-03-17T21:00:41.608Z'}, uuid=UUID('96b6494e-6e64-4589-8a42-d68f84adb18b'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nTim Bradshaw in London\\nLaw enforcement agencies including the FBI and the UK’s National Crime Agency have dealt a crippling blow to LockBit, one of the world’s most prolific cyber crime gangs, whose victims include Royal Mail and\\xa0Boeing.\\nThe international agencies behind “Operation Cronos” said on Tuesday that the ransomware group — many of whose members are based in Russia — had been “locked out” of its own systems. Several of the group’s central members have been arrested, indicted or identified and its core technology seized, including hacking tools and its “dark web” homepage.\\nGraeme Biggar, NCA director-general, said law enforcement officers had “successfully infiltrated and fundamentally disrupted LockBit”.\\n“LockBit has caused enormous harm and cost. No longer,” Biggar told a media conference in London, flanked by officials from the FBI, US Department of Justice and Europol. “As of today, LockBit is effectively redundant. LockBit has been locked out.”\\nSeparately, the US Treasury department on Tuesday said that it was placing sanctions on two affiliates of LockBit, citing the hack in November of the US-based financial services arm of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China’s largest bank, as part of the rationale.\\n“This action is the first in an ongoing collaborative effort with the US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and our international partners targeting LockBit,” the Treasury said.\\nLockBit had claimed responsibility for the hack, which shut down ICBC FS and disrupted trading in the $27tn US government bond market.\\nOver the past four years, LockBit has been involved in thousands of other ransomware attacks on victims around the world, from high-profile corporate targets to hospitals and schools.\\nThe hacking group’s technology , which locks organisations out of their own IT systems, has been used by a global network of hackers to inflict billions of dollars’ worth of damage against victims, through about $120mn in ransom payments and millions more in recovery costs, according to officials.\\nFive defendants have been charged in the US, officials said, including two Russian nationals. Two of the five are in custody. Another two alleged members of the gang were arrested in Ukraine and Poland on Tuesday, with law enforcement officials promising more to come.\\n“We will be closing in on those individuals,” said Biggar, adding that agencies had frozen about 200 cryptocurrency accounts and seized a “wealth of data” to fuel the investigation. “We’ve got a very clear understanding of the LockBit operation.”\\nThat included seizing about 11,000 domains and servers around the world, as well as gaining access to almost 1,000 potential decryption tools that could help more than 2,000 known victims regain access to their data.\\nSecurity researchers said earlier on Tuesday that LockBit’s website on hidden parts of the internet — the dark web — had been taken down and replaced by a message stating it was “now under control of law enforcement”. Officials said the move was designed to humiliate and undermine the fearsome reputation of the group’s hackers, even as hundreds of its members, affiliates and developers remained at large.\\n“There is a large concentration of these individuals in Russia,” said NCA’s Biggar, who added that, while there was “clearly some tolerance of cyber criminality” there, the investigation had “not seen direct support from the Russian state”.\\nFrom its Russian roots, LockBit has collaborated with an international criminal syndicate through a “ransomware as a service” model. The group rents out its malware to a loose network of hackers, who use it to paralyse a wide range of targets, from international finance groups and law firms to schools and medical facilities. LockBit typically takes a commission of as much as 20 per cent of any ransom paid by victims.\\nRecommended\\nLockBit’s attack in early 2023 on Royal Mail , the UK’s postal service, thrust the group into the spotlight, while November’s attack on the ICBC sent shockwaves through the financial world. That same month, gigabytes of data allegedly stolen from Boeing were leaked online after the aerospace group refused to pay a ransom.\\nThe group has become so notorious that some hackers even got tattoos of its logo, part of a promotional stunt for which LockBit offered a $1,000 payment.\\nChester Wisniewski,\\xa0global field chief technology officer at cyber security company Sophos, said that LockBit, which is believed to have first emerged in 2019, had risen to become the “most prolific ransomware group” in the past two years.\\n“The frequency of their attacks, combined with having no limits to what type of infrastructure they cripple, has also made them the most destructive in recent years,” he said. “Anything that disrupts their operations and sows distrust amongst their affiliates and suppliers is a huge win for law enforcement.”\\nHowever, Wisniewski added that “much of their infrastructure is still online”, suggesting there was still work to do to bring the hackers under the full control of law enforcement.\\nAdditional reporting by Kate Duguid, Suzi Ring, Mehul Srivastava and John Paul Rathbone', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1e9864ee-e041-4b21-984b-2fd4e1008cd9', 'title': 'Royal Mail hackers LockBit hobbled by global law enforcement', 'publication_time': '2024-02-20T11:12:14.603Z'}, uuid=UUID('5114a1d7-0619-4680-a294-5345030bb001'), db_id=''),\n",

Dublin-based technology group Ion Markets was also targeted by ransomware earlier that year, which knocked out parts of the financial plumbing that underlies the vast derivatives trading industry — forcing customers, at one point, to revert to old-fashioned paper ledgers.\\nAccording to a recent Bank of England survey of UK market participants, the risk of such attacks is now deemed the number one systemic risk to the financial system.\\n“The financial sector is grappling with an escalating onslaught from cybercriminals,” says Tris Morgan, managing director of security at telecoms group BT. His company’s data reveals, on average, “more than 46mn signals of potential cyber attacks every day, worldwide” — with banking emerging as the most vulnerable industry.\\nHackers target financial groups not just in an attempt to steal funds directly, but also to extract troves of highly sensitive personal information to then employ for further attacks, or to threaten to leak, as an extortion tactic.\\nMore data means a larger surface area to target and more potential blind spots\\nAccording to Steve Stone, head of Rubrik Zero Labs at security group Rubrik, financial services organisations already hold 20 per cent more data than those in other sectors. “More data means a larger surface area to target and more potential blind spots for [chief information security officers],” he says. “It is typically at the fringes where visibility is at its lowest and where gaps in security lie.”\\nIndeed, experts note a shift by increasingly bold cyber criminals from selling card data on underground marketplaces to deploying ransomware — which is becoming easier in an era of generative artificial intelligence and off-the-shelf tool kits. In 2023, the number of ransomware attack s in the finance industry surged by 64 per cent, and was nearly double the 2021 level, according to Sophos, a cyber security company.\\nLuke McNamara, deputy chief analyst at Mandiant Intelligence, Google Cloud’s cyber security business, adds that “entities within the financial sector” can also be a target for “espionage actors”, such as nation states, because they play a role in “politically sensitive functions, such as sanctions enforcement and compliance, or financing of high-profile or controversial projects”.\\nThe stakes are high. According to Philippe Thomas, chief executive of tech due diligence and audit tech group Vaultinum, hacks could lead to financial loss, disruption to a country’s financial infrastructure, and even threats to political stability “as confidence in financial markets is essential for global economic health”.\\nIn October, Lloyd’s of London warned that a significant cyber attack on a global payments system could cost the world economy $3.5tn.\\nRecommended\\nBeyond bank runs and instability, in a market where customer trust and confidence is vital, “a cyber breach can trigger immediate financial and reputational damage for fintech vendors themselves but also for the banks and brokers that rely on their software to trade clients’ money on public exchanges,” adds Thomas.\\nSo where are the vulnerabilities? In a 2023 KPMG survey of 142 banking CEOs, only 54 per cent said they were “well-prepared” for a cyber attack, with those feeling underprepared blaming the increasing sophistication of attackers, talent shortages and a lack of investment in cyber defence. However, some expressed a hope that nascent generative AI technology could help bolster their cyber response.\\nThis general lack of preparedness extends to monetary plumbing.\\nA 2023 IMF survey of 51 countries found that 56 per cent of the central banks or supervisory authorities do not have a national cyber strategy for the financial sector, and 64 per cent do not mandate testing and exercising cyber security measures.\\nThere is a consensus that financial services organisations need to invest in cyber attack simulations, stress testing, contingency planning, and crisis response. Stone says that, to mitigate risks, they need to “assess their data holdings, look at their operational risk management and consider their operational resilience to set them in the best stead for battling threats.”\\nExperts also say that industry-wide collaboration and increased regulatory harmonisation will be vital for survival. “Today, there is a lot of emphasis on intelligence gathering and sharing, to keep pace with the new tactics and techniques being utilised by threat actors,” says Jim Simpson, director of threat intelligence at cyber company Searchlight Cyber. He points to the intelligence sharing initiatives being led by cyber-focused non-profit FS-ISAC.\\nBut the responsibility for cyber security cannot stop there. Others emphasise the importance of addressing weaknesses all along the supply chain.\\n“Rapid technological adoption, like cloud services and mobile banking, coupled with increased reliance on external vendors, introduces new vulnerabilities and amplifies systemic risks due to the concentration in essential technology and service sectors,” cautions Thomas.\\n“This calls for higher scrutiny from clients of these third-party software providers.”', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a8b8de58-8691-4ece-ade3-5b7be63dbef2', 'title': 'Cyber attacks reveal fragility of financial markets', 'publication_time': '2024-01-16T05:00:08.565Z'}, uuid=UUID('ad3cb7c9-d56d-42ce-94d4-e2c4c3c5a7fc'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nBrooke Masters\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nNearly a year after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, it is tempting to dismiss the US regional banking crisis as a very loud tempest in a relatively small teapot. After all, the damage was contained to a handful of failed lenders, the sector has stabilised and the KBW regional banks index has regained most of its losses.\\nSuch insouciance would be a mistake. The crisis should serve as a wake-up call about the unanticipated dangers linked to online banking. The industry and its watchdogs must start preparing now if they are to prevent a larger disaster in the future.\\nAfter a string of bad decisions, SVB was ultimately toppled last March by a deposit run, a problem that is as old as banking. The basic business model involves a liquidity mismatch: banks take short-term money from depositors and make long-term loans and investments. If too many customers ask for their money back at once, any bank will struggle to come up with the cash. Should depositors panic, one run can destabilise other lenders.\\nWhat has changed is the speed with which these crises spread. Back in the Depression, Franklin Roosevelt was able to halt a month-long bank run by ordering lenders to shut their doors for a four-day holiday. In 2008, Washington Mutual went down after haemorrhaging $16.7bn over nine days.\\nThis time, SVB’s depositors pulled out $42bn in 10 hours. Another $100bn was heading out of the door when regulators shut it down. One day later, Signature bank lost 20 per cent of its deposits, and other lenders looked shaky. The US government promptly declared a systemic emergency.\\nThe difference now is digital. Not only do fears about banks spread like wildfire on social media, but customers can move their cash by tapping an app or clicking a mouse. That danger is only going to increase as instant payment systems spread.\\nThere are tried and trusted ways to protect against this kind of problem. Government deposit insurance helps keep money in place because retail customers know their accounts will be protected in a bank failure. Global liquidity rules put in place after 2008 force the largest banks to hold enough easy-to-sell securities to cover 30 days of projected outflows. And the US Federal Reserve’s discount window provides a liquidity lifeline by allowing banks to borrow cash, using their long-term assets as collateral.\\nBut none of that saved SVB, Signature or later First Republic. They relied heavily on big depositors, those with accounts too large to be protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That problem is only getting worse: US uninsured deposits have more than doubled from $2.3tn in 2009 to $7.7tn in 2022.\\nBoth banks were also small enough to escape the post-crisis liquidity rules and each proved incapable of tapping the discount window. SVB did not have the right operational arrangements in place, Signature repeatedly tried to use ineligible collateral.\\nBanking watchdogs are trying to address these problems. The FDIC put out a paper last year exploring whether to raise the current cap on deposit insurance or remove it entirely. Global regulators at the Financial Stability Board are doing a “deep dive” into rapid deposit flight and whether more buffers might be needed.\\nPerhaps the most intriguing proposal came last week from a top US banking watchdog. Michael Hsu, acting comptroller of the currency, wants to create an additional five-day liquidity rule that would require banks to have collateral in place to borrow from the Fed to staunch a high speed run. Even better, he would force all banks to tap the discount window at least once a year, if only to prove that they can.\\nBanks don’t love these proposals, to put it mildly. Lifting the insured deposit cap would require the FDIC fund to be 70 to 80 per cent bigger, a jump the industry would have to fund. Large lenders already covered by the 30-day liquidity rule oppose having extra requirements on top, and lenders of all sizes are concerned about any new buffers that would shrink the funds they have available for lending and other banking business. They warn that bank runs will be with us as long as we have banks, and all the rules in the world won’t prevent greedy or misguided executives from making dangerous mistakes.\\nThey are right on both counts, but cleaning up last March’s banking ructions, small as they were, cost the industry $16bn. Imagine the tab for a proper mess. If deposit runs are a fact of life, we had better find ways to slow them down before the entire system comes crashing down in the blink of a digital eye.\\nbrooke.masters@ft.com\\nFollow Brooke Masters with myFT and on X', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/86aa4b1a-31cf-4881-a0dd-b9dcb6001fc6', 'title': 'US bank regulation needs to enter the digital age', 'publication_time': '2024-01-24T05:00:05.031Z'}, uuid=UUID('725cc2ee-c353-4b21-938b-c13950557071'), db_id=''),\n",

Why? Because we have to. The fraudsters get smarter, savvier, quicker, more devious, more mischievous,” Erdoes said. “It’s so hard and it’s going to become increasingly harder.”\\nErdoes also said the bank suffered 45bn hacking attempts every day. However this figure was later corrected by JPMorgan, which said: “Ms Erdoes was referring to observed activity collected from our technology assets, malicious or not. This activity is then processed by our monitoring infrastructure.”\\n“Examples of activity can include user log ins like employee virtual desktops, and scanning activity, which are often highly automated and not targeted,” it added.\\nWestern lenders have suffered a surge in cyber attacks in the past two years, which has been partly blamed on Russian hackers acting in response to sanctions placed on the country and its banks following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\\nBut the use of artificial intelligence by cyber criminals has also increased the number of incidents and level of sophistication of attacks.\\nLast year, the number of ransomware attacks in the finance industry surged by 64 per cent, and was nearly double the 2021 level, according to Sophos, a cyber security company.\\nJPMorgan was the victim of one of the biggest cyber attacks on a bank a decade ago when the data on 83mn accounts — including 76mn households and 7mn business — were compromised.\\nSpeaking at the same Davos event, Gita Gopinath, deputy managing director of the IMF, said the use of AI by cyber criminals was raising concerns for policymakers.\\n“Given the tremendous uncertainty about the scale of the impact of this technology and the way it is evolving, policy could be playing catch-up,” she said. “We could risk having a big event before we actually work out how to fix it.”\\nGopinath said banks were among the biggest spenders on AI technology and that while there were many benefits for them in terms of improving productivity, there were also risks concerning data privacy and embedded bias in lending decisions.\\nShe added that the IMF was also concerned about the long-term risk of AI affecting the behaviour of financial markets.\\n“If we enter a world where all major banks are using this technology, which is being produced by three or four big companies, are we going to see supercharged herding behaviour, where AI bots or models are sentiment-driven and feed off of each other?\\n“You then end up with much bigger amplitudes in the financial cycle — you get big credit booms and big credit busts.

A broad investment in sectors undergoing secular growth, for instance via an ETF, should therefore be a relatively easy way to make money.\\nThat thinking is riddled with bugs. The cyber security sector provides an opportunity to reflect on this.\\nAs megatrends go, cyber security ticks many boxes. Attacks are becoming a bigger risk : a JPMorgan executive this week bemoaned a wave of attacks as fraudsters get “more devious, more mischievous.” There is more data around, and users access it from different places. Companies, governments and even cultural institutions such as the British Library are vulnerable.\\nWould-be hackers are becoming ever more sophisticated. The latest trend is to use artificial intelligence to identify security weaknesses. As KKR’s Henry McVey points out, that makes cyber security a very different way to play the AI boom.\\nInvestment in security is increasing accordingly. This year, it will be up 14.3 per cent from 2023 , according to Gartner. The UK’s Darktrace this month raised full-year revenue growth forecasts to between 23 and 24.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the current sector spend — expected to be $215bn in 2024 — is only a fraction of the potential market, which McKinsey puts at $1.5-2tn.\\nWith that tailwind, you might expect cyber security ETFs — catchily named HACK, CIBR and BUG — to be racing ahead. They are not. Over the past three years, they have underperformed the S&P 500. Over the past five years, even the pick of this bunch has only slightly outperformed the Nasdaq.\\nOne reason the cyber security megatrend has been so hard to tap into via an index is that — unlike say, supermarkets — today’s winners are not particularly likely to outperform tomorrow. Products have a short shelf life. Criminals are innovative and the nature of the threat keeps changing. New security tools need to be rolled out quickly.\\nThat makes even market leaders vulnerable to upstarts. Indeed, the first wave of cyber security products were sold by network companies which have since lost share to specialised outfits such as Fortinet and Palo Alto.\\nThis may be changing, however. Some companies, says Shaul Eyal of TD Cowen, are attempting to turn themselves into cyber security one-stop-shops, the metaphorical equivalent of Walmart or Tesco. Outfits such as Palo Alto are developing multiple technologies and supplementing them through bolt-on acquisitions, which should make them both larger and more resilient to changing threats.\\nBuying into such cyber platforms may be a better way to crack this investment megatrend.\\nLex is the FT’s concise daily investment column.

It is working with agencies including the FBI, to examine the incident.\\nIn a post late on Tuesday, X, formerly known as Twitter, said the “compromise” was caused by an “unidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number associated with the @SECGov account through a third party”. X went further and disclosed that the SEC’s account lacked two-factor authentication. “We encourage all users to enable this extra layer of security,” it added.\\nBy cyber security standards, a compromised X account is far less serious than a breach targeting the regulator itself, such as the hack of the SEC’s corporate filing system in 2016 that allegedly allowed traders to pocket at least $4.1mn in illegal profits.\\n“In the end, it’s just an embarrassment,” said Bruce Schneier, Harvard lecturer and security technologist. “In the greater scheme of things, no harm done.”\\nNevertheless, “this is kindergarten stuff”, he added. “This is not a subtle security decision, we have to make a committee and purchase a product and decide to deploy it. This is setting a two-factor authentication on your Twitter account.”\\nChris Pierson, chief executive of cyber security group BlackCloak, said that it was not uncommon for organisational accounts to operate without two-factor identification because setting up an authentication system for an account used by multiple people was more complicated.\\nX’s disclosure of the SEC’s failure to implement two-factor authentication surprised some analysts. But Pierson said it made sense in light of the commission’s tough new cyber security rules that require disclosure of any material cyber security event within four days.\\n“X didn’t have to do it, but they likely took the extra step because of the SEC’s focus on cyber security rules,” he said. “The SEC spent all of 2023 banging the drums on cyber security.”\\nX is controlled by Elon Musk, who has been a vocal and longtime critic of the SEC. In 2018, he agreed a settlement with the agency after being charged with securities fraud linked to a post on Twitter saying he was “considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” Musk subsequently bought Twitter, took it private and renamed it X.\\nThe SEC separately sued Musk in October to compel him to testify as part of a probe by the agency into his 2022 purchase of Twitter, a subpoena he has been fighting in court.\\nFor the SEC, the hack came just as the financial world’s sights were fixed on the regulator just hours before a highly anticipated deadline on whether to approve some of the at least 11 applications submitted by asset managers seeking to launch spot bitcoin ETFs.\\nIn the minutes after the fake post, bitcoin rose to be 1.5 per cent higher on the day but swiftly reversed once the post was debunked. The price then dropped as much as 3.4 per cent before rebounding a bit.\\nLawmakers in Washington have called for an investigation into what happened. Bill Hagerty, the Republican senator from Tennessee who has criticised the SEC’s tougher enforcement stance on crypto, called the incident “unacceptable” in an X post.\\n“Just like the SEC would demand accountability from a public company if they made such a colossal market-moving mistake, Congress needs answers on what just happened,” he added.\\nRepublicans on the House financial services committee have asked the regulator for a briefing on the incident. Sherrod Brown, the Democratic chair of the US Senate banking committee, which oversees the SEC, told the Financial Times in a statement he was “concerned” that the incident “could undermine our markets and the agency’s mission”. Cynthia Lummis, the Republican senator from Wyoming and crypto proponent, said in an X post on Tuesday that “we need transparency on what happened”.\\nRecommended\\nThe motive and nature of the hack remain unclear. It “could be ‘ha ha wasn’t that funny’ or ‘I made a bunch of investments and now I’m going to cash in on them’,” said Schneier, the Harvard lecturer and security technologist.\\nJames Elbaor, head of Marlton, a Chicago-based hedge fund that is active in the bitcoin market and other markets, said they had seen no “strange market movement that would have benefited from the hack”.\\n“I just think it was someone who should have known better, but not someone trying to make money,” he said. “Not that nefarious.”\\nAdditional reporting by Stephen Gandel and Hannah Murphy\\n', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/5237b597-1fbb-4fc9-af34-7cb0540740a9', 'title': 'Bitcoin X hack an ‘embarrassment’ for cyber security-conscious SEC', 'publication_time': '2024-01-10T21:06:44.360Z'}, uuid=UUID('c6437a7e-51c2-4ab6-a391-b1e43bb476ec'), db_id=''),\n",

In 2017, the “ WannaCry” attack is estimated to have cost the NHS £92mn and caused the cancellation of 19,000 patient appointments. Another hacking, in 2022, took down the non-emergency 111 service, and disrupted management systems for mental health services and emergency prescriptions.\\nRecommended\\nCyber attacks on hospitals in Germany and the US have also disabled their systems — forcing them to reschedule some procedures and temporarily divert patients to other facilities until the systems were brought back online.\\nAnd, in another case, in Finland , the confidential records of thousands of psychotherapy patients were hacked and leaked online — with others blackmailed to keep the data private, according to reports in the national media.\\n“Almost every hospital CEO I speak to\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009now [says] that cyber risk is their number one or number two enterprise risk issue,” says John Riggi, national adviser for cyber security and risk at the American Hospital Association (AHA), which represents hospitals and healthcare networks. “It’s one of the main issues that keep them up at night.”\\nTechnology is making cyber crime easier to commit. Tools and services are available on the dark web, so cyber criminals do not necessarily require sophisticated technical skills.\\nEven as healthcare organisations become better at protecting themselves from one type of attack, such as ransomware — by restoring locked data from backups, for example — cyber criminals switch tactics.\\nAlmost every hospital CEO I speak to\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009now [says] that cyber risk is their number one or number two enterprise risk issue\\nIndustry specialists report that some criminals now steal, rather than encrypt, highly sensitive medical data and threaten to publish it on the dark web, unless the healthcare provider or patient pays a ransom using a cryptocurrency.\\n“Ransomware operators have become smarter,” says Elia Zaitsev, chief technology officer at cyber security supplier CrowdStrike. “In many ways, the extortion model is actually simpler for them from a technical perspective.”\\nOld healthcare IT systems also make the process easier for criminals.\\nIn many NHS organisations, legacy systems can account for between 30 and 50 per cent of all IT services, says Josh Chandler, chief digital information officer at Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in eastern England.\\nSome of these old systems may have been designed more than 20 years ago and may not have been upgraded for more than 10 years, he adds. “[The IT systems] haven’t stayed up to date with technological advancements [while security] threats have increased around them.”\\nAnnual audits of an organisation’s cyber security and a “zero trust” approach (assume any user or device may be a risk until proven otherwise) can mitigate threats to old and new healthcare IT systems, experts say.\\nSo can widely used antivirus software, which protects computers and laptops from malware, ransomware and other information security threats, as well as “intrusion detection” software, which spots potential suspicious activity in hospital computer networks — for example, attempts to steal clinicians’ passwords or approve fake invoices.\\nIn addition, a new type of cyber security software — “extended detection and response” or “XDR” — can give organisations an overview of multiple security threats. It gathers data from IT applications, networks, hardware and email traffic, and sometimes uses artificial intelligence to monitor threats in real time.\\nThere is also specialist security software to protect hospital hardware: medical devices, including heart monitors, life support machines, and infusion pumps. It will play an even more vital role as the number of internet-connected medical devices rises from 503mn in 2021 to 760mn by 2026, based on forecasts from research company IDC.\\n“If you think about a hospital bed\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009it’s basically a computer acting as a bed,” says Katell Thielemann, a cyber security expert at research company Gartner. “For a long\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009time patient safety was sort of built in to the medical device manufacturing lifecycle, but [cyber] security was almost an afterthought.”\\nAlthough medical devices are not thought to be commonly hacked, the US Government Accountability Office, a spending watchdog, warned last year that security vulnerabilities within devices were a risk to hospital networks and patients.\\nRecommended\\nPoliticians appear to be taking notice. Last year, the US and UK governments announced strategies for strengthening cyber security in healthcare.\\nThe UK’s plan — which applies to England, but stresses the need to “work collaboratively” with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — includes identifying parts of the healthcare system where a cyber attack would cause the most harm to patients, and “embedding security” into emerging technology.\\nThe strategy of the US Department of Health and Human Services includes minimum standards for hospital cyber security — with bigger fines for non-compliance — and government funding to help the sector improve security.\\nThe AHA says it is keen to work with the US government to raise standards but adds that software suppliers must take action, too. “We need our technology providers to provide us with better secured technologies,” says Riggi.\\nThat — combined with adopting international standards for healthcare cyber security, and putting more cyber criminals in prison — may help the sector mitigate numerous threats, experts say. But it will probably remain a prime target for cyber criminals, they warn.\\n“The threats will evolve as attackers deploy new tactics, and the [defences] will evolve as cyber security tools mature,” says Gartner’s Thielemann. “It’s\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009a cat-and-mouse game.”', metadata={'query': 'Technological advancements in account security', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/77d54679-0915-4ce2-a42f-0c2b844da7ef', 'title': 'Cyber attacks are one of the biggest threats facing healthcare systems', 'publication_time': '2024-01-16T05:00:08.669Z'}, uuid=UUID('3ff6037c-3d3d-4032-b926-056d70240612'), db_id=''),\n",

       " 'Market trends in the streaming industry': [(Document(text='\\nChristopher Grimes in Los Angeles\\nSome of Netflix’s competitors are reversing a streaming war tactic by licensing their old TV shows and movies to the streamer — boosting its programming offerings but also potentially squeezing its profit margins, analysts say.\\nNetflix relied heavily on programming that it licensed from other companies when it launched its streaming service in 2007. But after Walt Disney, NBCUniversal, Paramount and the then Time Warner launched their own streaming services, they pulled many of their shows from Netflix to avoid feeding a company that had grown into an arch-competitor.\\nWith legacy media groups under pressure to produce streaming profits, however, licensing revenue is looking attractive again — even if it comes from Netflix. This summer, Warner Bros Discovery’s HBO network began licensing a handful of older shows to Netflix, including Insecure , Six Feet Under, Ballers and Band of Brothers.\\n“Conventional wisdom of the last 10 years was that you keep everything in house,” said Casey Bloys, HBO’s chief executive, at the recent Code conference. “But in the history of television, syndication — selling a show somewhere else — was the brass ring. It meant the show was successful and would have a life elsewhere.”\\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley said the return of licensing deals was a “long-term positive” for Netflix and would “pad” its lead over competitors in streaming. But the bank added that the cost of licensing — along with the Netflix’s investments in gaming and other sectors — could add pressure to its profit margins in 2024. The analysts raised their outlook for Netflix’s overall cash spending next year by $500mn to $17.7bn.\\nNetflix will report results on Wednesday, with investors expected to focus on whether it plans to increase subscription prices and signs of progress on its new advertising tier. The latest data on its password sharing crackdown will also be watched.\\nThe return of licensing deals has coincided with strikes in Hollywood, which halted production of new shows and are expected to delay TV and movie releases well into next year. The Writers Guild of America reached a deal with the studios in September after five months, but the SAG-AFTRA union representing actors is still on strike. Those talks collapsed last week after the union asked for a share of subscriber revenue from streamers, studio officials say.\\nDespite the gloom around the strikes, the studios’ experiments with licensing deals appear to have given some old shows new life. After NBCUniversal licensed its show Suits — which aired from 2011-19 and starred Meghan Markle — to Netflix in June, the show experienced a revival. The legal drama was in the top spot on the Nielsen Streaming top 10 for three months, an example of the “Netflix effect” on older shows.\\nBloys said licensing shows to Netflix had also boosted traffic for the programmes on Warner Discovery’s Max streaming platform, home to HBO programming including Ballers , a sports drama that ran from 2015-19. Ballers entered the Nielsen top 10 after it went to Netflix, and Insecure , a comedy starring Issa Rae that ran from 2016-21, had a similar boost.\\n“Without doing a thing on Max, the engagement on Ballers and Insecure really saw a spike when they were on Netflix,” he said at the Code conference. “The initial experiment we had with a couple of titles has had an immediate positive impact on Max.”\\nThere are limits, Bloys added, naming two popular HBO shows that may remain off-limits on Netflix. “I doubt you’ll see Succession or White Lotus , he said.', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/fd84f6bb-b3e1-4691-9b90-f6f90c16bae6', 'title': '‘Netflix effect’ returns as studios license old shows to their streaming rival', 'publication_time': '2023-10-17T04:00:12.781Z'}, uuid=UUID('d8b327ee-c7d7-4f94-ad51-85f3a18d30ef'), db_id=''),\n",

In Indonesia, the market share of TikTok’s live commerce business overtook Alibaba’s ecommerce platform in the past year. The threat posed by the new sector to traditional retail stores prompted the Indonesian government to introduce a nationwide ecommerce ban on these social media platforms. TikTok shut down its ecommerce shop in the country this week.\\nTraditional ecommerce is struggling to hold on to its shoppers.

Meanwhile, the same figure at streaming platform Douyin, owned by TikTok parent ByteDance, increased more than three-quarters.\\nShares of Alibaba are down 30 per cent from their January peak. JD.com’s have halved. The moves reflect concerns about slowing growth and the accelerating shift of shoppers to streaming platforms. TikTok rivals including Kuaishou are growing at a similar pace.

If the striking actors can reach an agreement with the studios in the next week or two, as many hope, the floodlights will soon be shining over Tinseltown again.\\nBut any celebration in Hollywood is likely to be shortlived. Disney and other traditional studios still have yet to turn a profit in their streaming services, and their once-mighty TV businesses are in a steep decline.\\nFor the writers and actors, cost-cutting by the studios means that while they will be earning more from their new contracts, there will probably be fewer shows getting the green light than during “peak TV”, a period that started around 2009 and appears to have ended this year.\\n“The writers did really, really well” in the contract negotiations,\\xa0said one senior Hollywood executive. But he added that there will be “repercussions” from the deal.\\n“The streamers are going to be more conservative” with their budgets, the executive said. “They’re going to be more cost-conscious\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009They’re going to develop less content.”\\nThe writers secured higher pay across the board in their new three-year deal, plus the potential to earn royalties from hit streaming shows. In all, the new package will cost an additional $233mn a year — less than the $429mn they were seeking but well above the initial offer from the studios. The new contract for actors is certain to add more costs for studios.\\nMembers of both unions insist that the studios can afford the pay rises despite industry headwinds. They point to high executive salaries and the companies’ long-term records of profitability as evidence that they can afford to pay up.\\nYet after pumping billions into streaming, the studios are under pressure to hold the line on content spending. Even Netflix has been keeping its budget steady at around $17bn since 2021.\\nThe difference is that Netflix makes money, unlike the streaming services launched by studios such as Walt Disney, Comcast’s NBCUniversal, and Paramount. Warner Bros Discovery said its streaming business turned a profit this year, but Disney’s streaming operation has lost more than $11bn since it launched in 2019. It does not expect the business to break even until next year.\\nIn the rush to reach profitability, most streaming services have been raising prices and have even introduced advertising, an idea that was once taboo in a business that was supposed to be propelled by ever-increasing subscriptions. But suddenly old ideas about how to make money from TV seem to be back on the table.\\nThe retro strategies that are coming back into fashion include streamers licensing\\xa0shows to each other, allowing the original network to keep making money from a programme after its initial run. Further price rises are also likely for some of the streaming services, including Netflix.\\nThen there is cancelling expensive or underperforming shows.\\xa0Streamers seem to have been especially ruthless about cutting shows in recent months, with Hulu axing The Great and Warner’s Max service ending Winning Time after just two seasons.\\nThere has also been discussion about a far more radical step, one that would reduce options for indulging a habit that is almost synonymous with streaming: binge watching. HBO was a pioneer in this regard, releasing regular weekly episodes of popular shows such as White Lotus, Succession and Winning Time .\\n“Will some of these streamers say: Hey, we’re wasting all our bullets at the same time,” the executive said. “ Will some start to [release] their shows in a different way, and will that mean they don’t have to make as many shows? ”\\nWith belt-tightening back in vogue in Hollywood, it seems like an idea that has a chance of getting the green light.\\n', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/fff2d064-3241-4b61-a16e-6bc773f3a6b8', 'title': 'Streamers and studios resurrect retro moneymaking ideas', 'publication_time': '2023-10-06T20:00:12.742Z'}, uuid=UUID('0ec19c54-8b6b-4837-a94b-1a8419c47a10'), db_id=''),\n",

The average cable TV package costs $83 a month.\\nAmericans had in recent years enjoyed the benefits of an extravagant era in Hollywood, during which media companies inundated audiences with more programming than ever at a fraction of the cost of traditional television.\\nEnticed by low prices, consumers rapidly cut the cable “cord” in favour of streaming services, with Disney+ attracting more than 100mn subscribers in only 16 months with a $6.99 subscription.\\nBut privately, media executives warned of a looming “ car crash ” as they splashed out tens of billions of dollars on TV shows and films.\\nAs interest rates have soared over the past year and a half, the crash has arrived. Media stocks have suffered a bruising correction as Wall Street grew impatient with the heavy streaming losses.\\nAfter watching their stock valuations more than halve, Warner Bros and Disney have shifted towards austerity, laying off thousands of staff and raising their subscription prices to curb billion-dollar streaming losses. Even Netflix ditched its basic $9.99 advertisement-free monthly subscription earlier this year, with new customers paying $15.49.\\n“From a business point of view, streaming was going to have to move in this way — the price\\xa0point was going to have to go up,” said David Rogers, a Columbia Business School professor and author of The Digital Transformation Roadmap . “This was accelerated by the fact that we no longer have cheap debt to flood the market with streaming content.”\\nDisney’s latest price increases mark the second time it has raised subscription fees in less than a year, with the monthly cost of its ad-free service rising by $3 to $13.99 from October. Its Hulu service will also increase the price of its ad-free subscription by $3 to $17.99, but the two services are offered as a package for $19.99 a month.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nThere are cheaper streaming options, of course, but those come with another unloved feature of old-school TV: advertising. “We’re very optimistic about the long-term advertising potential of this business, even amid a challenging ad market,” said Bob Iger, Disney chief executive, this week.\\nHe noted that the company had signed up 3.3mn subscribers to the ad-supported version of Disney+, which costs $7.99.\\nIger also said that Disney would begin cracking down on password sharing — another move first taken by Netflix, which has successfully converted many freeloaders into paying customers this year.\\nSome analysts questioned whether the price increases will slow, or even reverse, Disney’s subscriber growth — especially at a time when Iger is also planning to cut budgets for streaming shows and movies.\\nRecommended\\n“Does cutting back on content and raising prices work?” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners. “Can you raise prices another 30-plus per cent, reduce content spending and continue to grow subscriptions or maintain subscriptions?”\\nRogers said there were ways to\\xa0encourage subscribers to keep paying. “At a certain point you’ve got to watch out for people unsubscribing,” he said. “But [streamers] also have mechanisms for that — they can give a discount if you buy for a year rather than pay month to month.”\\nAs a historic Hollywood labour strike continues, these entertainment giants also risk running out of new shows at the same time that they are wringing consumers for more cash.\\n“[Disney] is asking more and more of the customer\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009while the amount of new content on offer will likely decline,” said analysts at media consultancy Enders, who warned of “a negative spiral and real consequences” if the strike drags on.\\n“Lack of fresh content, particularly for Disney+, will increase churn,” they added.\\n', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/02e7e67d-8367-427e-9aa7-e66c7f7fa8a1', 'title': 'Hollywood calls time on golden era of cheap streaming', 'publication_time': '2023-08-12T13:00:00.348Z'}, uuid=UUID('504f23c3-5dcf-4088-9040-b3099c39dfec'), db_id=''),\n",

The result was a 5.9mn bump in subscriber numbers in this year’s second quarter that was hailed as a show of strength by some analysts. But this is only a temporary fix.\\nLike ride-sharing company Uber, Netflix priced its streaming service at low rates to attract the biggest audience possible. Like Uber, it was then bombarded by rivals willing to spend large sums to compete. Six years ago, Netflix claimed that its only real competition was sleep. Now it includes comparisons to streaming competitors in its shareholder letter.\\nAs its shareholders grow weary of subsidising online services, prices are rising. NBCUniversal’s Peacock just lifted its cheapest monthly rate by $1 and Disney+’s US revenue per subscriber has picked up by 20 per cent in the past year.\\nThis means Netflix’s increases do not stand out. It is still the sector leader with nearly 239mn subscribers and expects another increase this quarter. But Netflix must spend more on marketing to draw in those subscribers.\\nLower costs are temporary too. In a repeat of the shutdowns that occurred during Covid-19 lockdowns, the Hollywood writers’ strike has stopped production of films and TV shows. That means Netflix will spend less on content. Free cash flow is expected to be at least $5bn this year, up from $1.6bn in 2022. Long-term debt has come down as well to $14.1bn from $14.9bn two years ago. One can sense that the focus is on level-headed financial decisions just by the near total lack of chatter about video games — an expensive endeavour that Netflix is also involved in.\\nBut when all of the users who were sharing passwords pay up or leave, Netflix will have to find new sources of revenue growth. Advertising subscriptions are not yet large enough for Netflix to choose to put a number on them. It is also a crowded field. Everyone, from YouTube to Uber, now tries to attract ad dollars.\\nIf Netflix wants to keep its focus on tweaking payments it could remove monthly subscriptions altogether and reduce churn by offering only annual or 18-month plans.

No one had yet heard of Disney Plus or the streaming wars.\\nBut after the platform lost subscribers early last year, Hastings called time on this breezy attitude towards password sharing, which has given rise to an estimated 100mn Netflix freeloaders around the world.\\nIn recent days, the company has launched password crackdowns in the US, UK and more than 100 other countries. In the US, it has told customers that if they want to share their password, they must pay $7.99 a month to add a person outside their home, or $6.99 if they are prepared to have an account with adverts.\\nThe crackdown plus the new push into advertising reflect the tough realities of the streaming business model that Netflix pioneered. In the boom times, investors were willing to overlook eight- or nine-figure quarterly losses as long as subscription growth was strong. Now, however, new sign-ups have slowed and competition is intense. In the US, the average household has 5.5 streaming subscriptions, notes Jennifer Chan, global strategic director at research group Kantar.\\n“Overall household streaming penetration hasn’t changed very much since the end of Covid,” Chan said. “So the focus for streamers now is on retaining their current customer base and becoming the priority subscription so that consumers aren’t cancelling — and if they are, how do you win them back.”\\nInvestors meanwhile want to see a path to profitability, putting serious pressure on most of the major streaming services to slash costs and come up with new strategies to generate cash.\\nNetflix is profitable, but Disney Plus, Paramount Plus and NBCUniversal’s Peacock are still racking up hefty losses. Warner Bros Discovery, which aggressively cut costs after the companies were combined in a $40bn merger last year,\\xa0recently told investors it expected to turn a profit in its streaming business a full year ahead of schedule and that this part of the business made $50mn in profit in the most recent quarter.\\nLike Netflix, Warner has been making big changes to its streaming service.

The combined service was renamed Max, and the company hopes the broader offering will increase customer numbers and engagement.\\nDisney chief executive Bob Iger plans a similar move later this year by merging child-friendly Disney Plus and Hulu, which focuses on general entertainment aimed at adults, into one app. Iger said this would boost sales of Disney’s with-adverts subscription packages, another step towards reaching its goal of turning a profit in streaming next year. In the meantime he must also address investor worries about subscriber growth — the company’s streaming services have lost customers for the past two quarters.\\nNetflix may face similar problems of retaining customers as it cuts password sharing options. In early trials, Netflix said some users dumped the service, with as many as 1mn cancellations in Spain alone, according to Kantar. While many return — either adding new accounts or opting for the cheaper ad-supported version — there is still some risk, Chan says.\\n“If people are to cancel their subscription, they will be exposed to life without Netflix” and perhaps switch to other services, she said. “I think people will come back, but they may not regain their whole subscriber base.”', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a85f2d38-1889-4108-92af-525ed924b133', 'title': 'Netflix is taking a necessary risk in tackling its 100mn freeloaders', 'publication_time': '2023-05-26T04:00:49.086Z'}, uuid=UUID('1f993249-eb24-4a83-8ae7-f9a8072aaa62'), db_id=''),\n",

Today, a rift at the heart of the telecoms sector risks reversing decades of progress and plunging digital allies into a new phase of conflict.\\nEurope’s telecom companies want US corporations such as Alphabet, Netflix, Amazon and Meta to pay for the increasing video traffic they generate. These US giants originate data accounting for around 50 per cent of network loads. Europe’s telcos complain they bear massive additional costs without receiving any fees or extra revenues.\\nFor their part, the US corporations argue that such cross-industry subsidies are a form of protectionism. Indeed, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon already pay for their distribution platforms and related costs for content rights and production. They see these requests as a form of expropriation of their profits, which are much larger than those of the EU telcos.\\nAs a result, member states, industry associations and European MPs stand divided on the issue, while the EU Commission has launched a consultation on the future of the telecoms industry. The discussion over such profound and complex questions will fuel aggressive lobbying from all sides and possibly end up in litigation. Europe instead needs a balanced approach which addresses the legitimate funding requirements of the telecoms companies without unfairly punishing content providers.\\nThere is a strong social argument for ensuring that telcos earn a decent return on capital. At the moment its stands at a meagre 4 per cent, according to a recent analysis of established operators by JPMorgan, which is too low. A higher return would ensure there is adequate investment in ultra-wide and low-latency broadband (fibre and 5G) that would benefit both the welfare of citizens and the companies’ competitiveness. Industrial, agricultural, health, educational and mobility applications need fast, secure and low-latency networks. At the same time, it is clearly in the interest of European citizens that platforms distributing quality content can operate and thrive in Europe. It is right that, rather than feeling squeezed, US corporations contribute a fair proportion of the costs associated with distributing their videos.\\nA sensible compromise would be to only seek contributions from the largest operators — for example those loading above 5 or 7.5 per cent of a single network. These payments could be negotiated bilaterally between platforms and telecom companies, since investment requirements and networks are different. Antitrust authorities and regulators would only need to intervene — granting powers to access information and imposing a mandatory contribution based on\\xa0the existing “abuse of economic dependence” legislation — if no agreement could be reached.\\nThis approach would protect net neutrality and encourage genuine negotiations, reducing the risk of regulatory decisions which take time and often have unintended consequences. A market solution with safeguards is surely better than straight regulation or, worse, inaction.\\nHowever, these changes will not solve the networks’ problems with profitability and investment on their own. The EU should allow more in-market consolidation in the telecoms industry, reduce the support governments give to low-investment operators, and stop facilitating the assignment of frequencies to new entrants: all policies which distort fairness for established networks\\xa0and squeeze them\\xa0for spectrum renewals.\\nIn short, the EU should reward those who are willing to invest. Much as with the transatlantic telegraph cables, all sides stand to gain from a robust, innovative and future-proof European telecoms infrastructure.\\n', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/ffc2d92b-ee89-4699-9a10-dc6a477f52a6', 'title': 'Battles over the cost of video traffic are creating a rift across the Atlantic', 'publication_time': '2023-04-30T12:00:19.499Z'}, uuid=UUID('0b252891-b214-4b61-9f43-46a100f555e8'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nFor Netflix, growth may come at the cost of prestige.\\nThe streaming service is under pressure to expand its subscriber base while keeping costs down. Adding a cheaper $6.99 per month advertising subscription tier and stepping up efforts to crack down on password sharing should be doing the trick.\\nBut these are not the sort of moves that endear a company to its customers or drive the zeitgeist and win Oscars. Nor is shutting a mail-order DVD business whose revenue halved last year.\\nNetflix is always first to start the tech earnings season , often setting the tone for consumer-facing companies. This time last year, it announced its first subscriber drop in a decade, triggering a sharp fall in the share price. This year looks steadier, though margins and revenue forecasts remain underwhelming.\\nIn the first quarter, the company added 1.75mn net subscribers. It helps that rivals such as Disney have been forced to accept that expensive streaming content requires higher subscription prices. HBO Max just provided an own goal by naming its streaming service Max, dropping the only part of its name that is associated with popular shows.\\nStill, revenue up less than 4 per cent for the first three months of the year does not befit a growth stock, even if it is better than the sub 2 per cent growth reported at the end of last year. Netflix is asking investors to be patient and wait for the third quarter to see the impact of change, while tempting them with promises of higher free cash flow and share repurchases to come.\\nIt is putting in serious efforts to cut costs. Total streaming content obligations, ie what Netflix plans to spend on content, have fallen from a high point of more than $23bn in 2021 to $21.5bn. Continuing to make multi-episode dating shows such as Love is Blind instead of expensive films may not win the company glitzy awards but it will drive those numbers down even further.\\nIf you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/54188f33-5bd2-4f46-b71d-30d542b1b48d', 'title': 'Netflix: cheaper content and more subscribers won’t make up for disappointing forecasts', 'publication_time': '2023-04-18T23:56:57.530Z'}, uuid=UUID('d3874f2f-d502-4be5-a31f-846979260fd0'), db_id=''),\n",

Sign up here to get the complete newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Wednesday and Friday\\nDear reader,\\nAfter the remarkable rise and fall of tech stocks in the past two years, the general assumption is that 2023 will be fine. Not a blowout, nor a blow-up. Yes, the sight of SpaceX’s latest rocket suffering a “rapid unscheduled disassembly” on Thursday was ominous. But optimism about IT spending and prospects for artificial intelligence is keeping spirits high.\\nNetflix started things off with news that it had added subscribers in the first quarter — a bonus after the shock fall last year.\\nNews that Netflix is closing its DVD service led headlines. Cracking down on password sharing in an effort to lift revenue will have a greater impact. Lex is also keeping a close eye on Netflix’s gargantuan content obligations — the amount it plans to spend on films and television shows. It is worth noting that this number is falling. Will spending less put off future viewers? It’s a gamble that depends on rival streaming services taking the same path.\\nIn reality, the Nasdaq Composite is up 17 per cent this year, mostly because interest rates seem to be on hold. But tech companies have also ruthlessly culled jobs in order to present themselves as financially responsible. The biggest are still sitting on mountains of cash. Mergers and acquisitions may be coming later this year — if heavy-handed regulators don’t nix plans.\\nWill that spur the moribund market for initial public offerings too? There are some signs of life. New York-based online ticketing company SeatGeek is reported to have filed to go public. There are several companies with multibillion-dollar valuations sitting on the sidelines, including Reddit , Stripe , Instacart and Discord .\\nLex thinks chat app Discord’s subscription-based revenue marks it out for potential success. Revenue was reported to have exceeded $500mn in 2021. It may be closer to $800mn or $1bn this year. Compare that with Twitter subscriptions, which are estimated at just $28mn. For now, however, Discord remains lossmaking. If it could show positive cash flow before seeking an IPO, that would encourage extra interest.\\nIn pharma, M&A is already on fire. This week, US pharmaceutical company Merck announced it would acquire Prometheus Biosciences for $10.8bn , following in the footsteps of Pfizer’s $43bn deal for Seagen and Amgen’s $28bn acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics.\\nMerck is paying $5bn more than Prometheus was valued at three days before the bid. But Merck needs to find new drugs as blockbusters roll off patent — as cancer treatment Keytruda will in 2028.\\nIn the UK, GSK followed the same pattern with its $2bn acquisition of Canadian biotech Bellus Health — double the undisturbed price. GSK is using the funds it reaped from spinning off consumer division Haleon in order to add new drugs to its pipeline. Bellus has camlipixant, a chronic cough treatment, in stage 3 trials. Lex expects more M&A, and higher premiums, this year.\\nMorgan Stanley has told analysts it is predicting a pick-up in M&A this year — an attempt to soothe nerves after it reported a near 20 per cent drop in profits in the first quarter.\\nIt also claimed that its mix of businesses helped it to ride out the uncertainty that followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Elsewhere, SVB’s failure has prompted some existential questions. Given the inherent mismatch between long-term assets and short-term liabilities, are banks that take deposits the best allocators of capital? Blackstone certainly sees an opening in private credit.\\nGoldman Sachs posted a $470mn loss on the partial sale of its Marcus loan portfolio, conceding that its push for consumer lending had misfired. But it hasn’t given up altogether — and is offering a new high-paying savings account.\\nUS brokerage and bank Charles Schwab announced that its client deposits had fallen 30 per cent from the same time a year ago. Happily for Schwab, however, much of that money moved to its own money market funds.\\nBut for US regional banks , finding profits when costs are rising and regulations are expected to be toughened up is going to be tricky. Even if first-quarter results this week were better than expected, with most posting a year-on-year rise in net income, deteriorating credit quality is worth worrying about. Lex thinks the largest and smallest banks are best placed to ride out the uncertainty.\\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, global military expenditure topped $2tn for the first time last year. Military spending is still on the rise, as the war in Ukraine drives orders for weapons. Look at China’s DJI, the world’s largest drone maker, whose products have been used in the war .\\nIn the US, funding for military research and development rose by a quarter between 2012 and 2021. Yet Lockheed Martin , whose anti-tank missiles are used in Ukraine, reported a drop in revenue and net income last year and another earnings dip in the first quarter. However, that is likely to reverse in the wake of new contracts.\\nOn a happier note, the coronation of King Charles III may give British pubs a boost . About 6,600 have shut down in England and Wales over the past decade. High energy prices, high taxes on beer and a general preference for coffee over beer have all played their part. As one reader noted, it fits with a trend of local post offices and bank branches closing too.\\nBut Lex has some comforting words for those mourning pubs. Not every closure is forever — some open under new management or convert to restaurants. Pub sales are rising too — up 5.5 per cent from 2019. Dutch brewer Heineken reported that demand in its important regions in the Americas and Europe was better than expected in the first quarter.\\nWe also have a suggestion for landlords: add more low- and no-alcohol options. It helped in the past. Before the first world war, beer was twice as strong. Milder drinks combated moral objections to public drunkenness. This time they might lure in a few more health-conscious customers.\\nTwitter created the blue check mark in 2009 after celebrities such as Kanye West complained about being impersonated. This week, it began removing them as part of an ill-judged attempt to strong-arm users into paying. I loved this funny obit to Twitter from one addicted user at the New York Times: “It’s possible the party will stretch on until sunrise, when the more sensible guests will return. But for now, someone just turned up the lights, and it’s probably time to ask ourselves: What exactly have we been doing here for the last decade and a half?”\\nEven social media influencers are talking about the harm that constant scrolling and parasocial relationships can do, according to this article on “ meta-content ” from The Atlantic.\\n“If data really is the oil of the 21st century then Michael Bloomberg is today’s John D Rockefeller.” Bloomberg contemplates life without its founder in this FT article from Robin Wigglesworth.\\nEnjoy your weekend,\\nElaine Moore Deputy head of Lex\\nIf you would like to receive regular Lex updates, do add us to\\xa0your FT Digest , and you will get an instant email alert every time we publish.

It is also in early discussions with US exchanges about launching futures linked to individual genres, artists and songs, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions.\\nIts long-term plan is seeking to capitalise on the rapid financialisation of the music business as deep-pocketed investors battle to secure the revenue streams associated with streaming.\\nIn recent years, private equity groups including Blackstone and KKR have spent billions of dollars on the back catalogues of artists such as Leonard Cohen, Neil Diamond and Bruce Springsteen in the hope of securing regular flows of income that are immune to economic downturns. Other famous acts, such as Pink Floyd, have explored selling their rights or turning their catalogues into asset-backed securities.\\n“Music is an asset class that’s hiding in plain sight and hasn’t been unlocked,” said David Umeh, founder and chief executive of Clouty.\\nGoldman Sachs last year predicted that revenue in the global music industry would grow at a compound annual rate of 12 per cent between 2021 and 2030, with revenues hitting more than $150bn.\\nAs this rush continues, the development of markets allowing investors to trade music rights in a secondary market is “an inevitability”, according to Umeh. “Whether in growth or a recession, people are going to stream,” he added.\\nClouty, a three-person company, is conducting a seed funding round but faces an uphill battle to turn an offbeat asset class into a long-term tradeable market. Futures markets can take years to build depth and liquidity. Big futures exchanges such as CME Group have offered contracts on unusual assets, including air temperature, water and hurricanes, but they have failed to gain traction.\\n“There have been many instances of futures that have failed to succeed, even on well-understood products. They’re usually too complex to understand, or too complex to price or understand when it comes to calculating their volatility,” said Andy Simpson, chief executive of Sigma Financial AI, a trading technology company.\\nClouty has secured the permission of Bloomberg to display its Musiq 500 index, which tracks the revenues generated by streaming of the top 500 songs globally, on the financial data provider’s terminals. The value of the index has risen more than 25 per cent year on year to more than $10,000. It then intends to launch indices by genre and then individual songs. A futures contract would also need regulatory approval.\\nExecutives who have seen Clouty’s pitch question whether it can find a use by big institutional investors and draw in market makers, whose daily buying and selling helps build liquidity. One potential investor had reservations that the indices were built on streaming, and not royalties.\\nThe large sums pouring into the music business have created risks and potential rewards for streaming platforms and rights holders, creating a natural user base for futures contracts, Umeh said.\\nRecommended\\nThe unexpected revivals of songs used on TV shows, like Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill” on Stranger Things or Depeche Mode’s “Never Let Me Down Again” on The Last of Us , have generated new millions of dollars in royalty payments for the holders of the publishing rights.\\nBut companies such as Netflix and HBO may ultimately face higher costs in licensing the rights to the songs, and could use a futures market to hedge the risk.*\\nInvestors who have spent heavily on music rights could also use futures to shield themselves against the risk of artists falling out of fashion. *This story has been amended to clarify the types of companies at risk', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/a8cf1934-22d0-490f-ab89-bfd149ed15b7', 'title': 'Music financing\\xa0boom reverberates to markets', 'publication_time': '2023-01-25T05:00:43.387Z'}, uuid=UUID('3462b19c-ffa4-4e3b-8422-5aee5c0bfb83'), db_id=''),\n",

Excluding production shutdowns during the coronavirus pandemic, the rate of expansion is the lowest in more than a decade where total worldwide spending jumped from $128bn to $243bn.\\nCommercial broadcasters such as RTL, Mediaset and ITV are facing some of the most severe pressure. Ampere predicts total original spending will fall by 3 per cent as the sector tries to cope with an advertising downturn, rising production costs and declining audiences for linear channels.\\nBut streaming services have also begun to enter more straitened times, as media groups rein in costs to manage slower than expected subscriber growth and ballooning losses from establishing the platforms.\\nTotal content spending for subscription streaming services, such as HBO Max, Disney Plus and Netflix , will continue to increase but at a rate of 8 per cent rather than the 25 per cent breakneck growth in 2022.\\n“Services will continue to focus on original content to compete in a crowded, cost-sensitive market, but we are already seeing a shift in content commissioning to incorporate a greater volume of cheaper unscripted formats,” said Hannah Walsh, research manager at Ampere.\\nRecommended\\nNetflix, which accounts for about 25 per cent of spending on original streaming shows, said it was holding spending steady at around $17bn a year, while trying to make its shows more “impactful”. “The key for me is not that you have to spend more and more money,” said Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s co-chief executive, last month. “It’s: can you get more impact per million dollar spend than anybody else?”\\nMeanwhile, big legacy media companies such as Disney , Paramount and Warner Bros Discovery are facing another year of heavy streaming losses, with Morgan Stanley estimating content costs per subscriber will be almost double that of Netflix while revenue per member will be lower.\\nExcluding Netflix, Morgan Stanley estimates streaming services suffered operating losses of around $10bn in 2022. Losses are expected to peak for some services in what the analysts called a “tipping point year” where it will be clear costs are reaching “unsustainable levels”.\\n“Streamers are raising prices and cutting costs,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note to clients. “If these moves do not deliver meaningful streaming profits, we see two options (not mutually exclusive): give up and/or consolidate.”', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/d9a7cded-d43f-4d89-9271-44bf6516d476', 'title': 'Decade-long spending boom on original TV content expected to slow', 'publication_time': '2023-01-03T05:01:00.027Z'}, uuid=UUID('dd17183d-1dc0-4dc3-85eb-4b0582db6b82'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nRobert Armstrong\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nGood morning. The FTX story is not getting any prettier , and I have responded as any serious financial journalist would: by writing about the CEO’s clothes . If you have something less frivolous to say as we slide into the holiday season, email it to me: robert.armstrong@ft.com .\\nAbout 10 years ago I was talking about the TV business with Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson, then the FT’s media correspondent. Streaming was still something of a novelty. I said something to “Edge” about cable TV’s channel bundles looking obsolete when streaming offered a cheaper, more à la carte model. Cord-cutting can only accelerate from here, I predicted. He responded that the cable TV model was unbelievably profitable for everyone involved, so great efforts would be made to keep it going, and that live sports were crucial to that.\\nEdge was right. Disney’s business — which includes ESPN, the premier sports network on US cable — exemplifies his point. Back in 2012, Disney’s cable and broadcast TV revenues were $19.4bn. In the fiscal year just ended, revenue from cable and broadcast TV was $28.3bn. In other words, in the 10 years since I predicted the death of traditional TV, that business grew (for Disney) at an average rate of 3.8 per cent a year, faster than the economy. I’ve written a lot here about growth being unpredictable. Decline is unpredictable, too.\\nBut of course, streaming has absolutely exploded, too. Disney’s streaming business generated an additional $19.6bn in revenue last year. So Disney’s total revenue from video content watched at home has grown at a stonking 9 per cent a year for the past 10 years. But there is the small matter of profit. Disney operating profit from television, fiscal 2012: $6.6bn. Fiscal 2022: $4.4bn.\\nThat ‘22 profit number is a bit deceptive, though. It includes a $4bn loss in the streaming business, while margins in traditional TV have slid, but not crashed. Hence, two interlocking questions are essential to Disney’s valuation:\\nCan the losses in streaming be slowed, and ultimately reversed, and on what timetable?\\nWhat is the decline path for the traditional TV business?\\nTwo weeks ago, Disney chief executive Bob Chapek took a shot at that first question, arguing that the losses would start to decline. He gave three reasons:\\nFirst, the benefit of both price increases and the launch of a Disney Plus ad tier next month. Second, a realignment of our cost, including meaningful rationalisation of our marketing spend. And third, leveraging our learnings and experience in direct-to-consumer to optimise our content slate and distribution.\\nIt is probably worth mentioning that Chapek has since been sacked , and replaced on an interim basis by his predecessor, Bob Iger. But Chapek’s exit does not seem to have anything to do with Disney’s streaming strategy (as far as I can tell, the main problem is that the rest of Disney’s senior leadership found him extremely annoying).\\nIn any case, I believe the streaming losses are likely to subside over time. Subscriber growth will tail off soon, bringing acquisition costs down (Disney now has more streaming subscribers than Netflix). Netflix has managed to drag margins and free cash flow up — so why can’t Disney? Both companies also have plans to increase prices and introduce an ad-supported tier, making those transitions easier for each of them.\\nIf you believe that the streaming losses are set to decline, it is easy to make a case for owning the shares. The stock price has been cut in half since early 2021. Earnings per share for the current year are expected to come in at something over $4 (a year ago, analysts expected more than $6), and the price/earnings ratio is 23. But the “e” in the denominator should grow quickly as the streaming losses fall; Disney made over $8 in 2018. And its other big business, theme parks, goes from strength to strength.\\nThis is how the bullish analysts on Wall Street argue, anyway. I am just slightly sceptical. I think question #2 — the decline rate of the traditional TV business — is even harder and more important than question #1.\\nTraditional TV is still a much bigger business for Disney than streaming. And it is clear that the business will continue to decline, and it seems likely the decline will accelerate. In the past five years, the number of cable TV subscribers in the US has declined at 4.6 per cent a year, according to IbisWorld. At the same time, the revenues Disney has drawn from that diminishing customer pool have risen (at least until very recently). This cannot go on. Gareth Sutcliffe of Enders Analysis sums up:\\nBroadcasters have managed to keep channels’ revenues growing due to increases in the licence fees charged to pay-TV operators and from advertisers accepting a greater cost per impact. It seems that the unsustainable discrepancy between shrinking audiences and increasing revenues from linear television has reached the tipping point.\\nA lot of the content that is still wanted on cable will be watched on streaming services in the future. This includes sports (note Amazon’s acquisition of the rights to Thursday night American National Football League games, surely the camel’s nose under the tent of cable sports). This leads us to question #3: when TV audiences, especially sports fans, move from cable to streaming, how much profit will they bring with them?\\nOne thing the newspaper business learned the hard way is that when a media industry switches distribution systems it can lose a lot of profit, even if its audience does not shrink. The dynamics for TV are obviously different, but I just don’t know how to this is going to play out.\\nAs Iger stems the streaming losses, Disney could well get a nice pop in profits in the next year or so, and the stock could do well. But even if that is true, it is unclear whether Disney will ever return to the levels of profitability of four or five years ago. I’m not sure if the stock is cheap or not. I’ll keep working on it.\\nI read this a day or two ago and thought: is it time to underweight the US?', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/5424b364-eb89-4693-a032-f89ab21003b1', 'title': 'Is Disney cheap?', 'publication_time': '2022-11-23T06:30:24.281Z'}, uuid=UUID('8d38f48d-f699-4f04-a5cc-f5f1c9bca0bf'), db_id=''),\n",

Rival services including Hulu, Peacock and Paramount Plus have ad-supported versions, and Disney Plus plans to roll out ads next month.\\nSelling ads is one way Netflix executives plan to generate new sources of revenue. Its subscriber base shrank for two consecutive quarters this year, leading to a halving of its market value.\\nIn a presentation to reporters and investors, the company’s officials acknowledged that not all of its premium tier content will be available on the ad-supported plan. But they say shows that receive 85 to 90 per cent of the viewing time spent on the service will be available, including popular fare such as The Crown.\\nSome studios may want to see how well Netflix’s ad-based service works before agreeing on whether to place shows on the service, said a person with knowledge of the discussions.\\n“It could be weeks after they launch, when they know more about what’s working and what’s not” before some deals are signed, the person said.\\nNetflix does not own some of its most popular programmes such as Seinfeld , Gilmore Girls and NCIS , but licenses them from rival studios such as Sony, Warner Bros and Universal.\\nSome of these licences — which were drafted when Netflix’s management had been staunchly against advertising on the service — do not allow for the content to run on this new service. In some cases contracts explicitly prohibit programmes from being shown on an ad-supported tier if Netflix ever decided to launch one.\\nStudios have been negotiating with Netflix for months about licences for the service, said people familiar with the matter. Among them is Sony, which does not have a streaming service but has taken an “arms dealer” strategy of selling film and TV rights to the highest bidder.\\n“If you’re Sony, they’re going to take a pound of flesh out,” said an executive at an investment group that acquires media copyright royalties. “It’s like going to a hotel. This [room] has a view of the ocean as opposed to a view of the mountains. You’re going to have to pay more money.”\\nNetflix said the new ad-supported service, which will cost $6.99 a month, is not “a revenue sharing model” at the moment, but the industry expects it will shift that position soon.\\nRecommended\\nFor the studios and talent, the negotiations over the advertising-based streaming service represent a larger opportunity than just a cut of the ad revenue. They also hope to regain some of the performance-based pay, or “back end”, that they have lost in the streaming era.\\nUnder the current system, talent behind Netflix hits such as Squid Game did not share the spoils of their success. “It’s not like Netflix is paying me a bonus. Netflix paid me according to the original contract”, Hwang Dong-hyuk, the creator of the show, said last year .\\nWith its subscription-based model, Netflix has been able to provide far fewer data about how its shows perform than traditional TV networks do. But the company will begin working next year with Nielsen, the ratings service, to gather the detailed data that advertisers demand.\\nA big question is whether this will “lead to a performance-based back end for the creative talent”, said Stephen Saltzman, head of the international entertainment group at law firm Fieldfisher. “I believe that it will put more pressure on Netflix to come up with performance-based metrics and compensation for the creative community.”', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/f21e934d-acbe-4c4b-ac15-a3a6460abdd2', 'title': 'Hollywood seeks a cut as Netflix debuts ad-supported streaming', 'publication_time': '2022-11-02T05:01:01.600Z'}, uuid=UUID('a2b723d3-2987-48d9-bed8-fdc8c375a852'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nLike a tech start-up, Netflix is valued as if user growth is the most important metric. Vast content commitments, losses and heavy debt have all been tolerated so long as this number rises. When it fell, so did the share price. Netflix’s solution is to stop reporting guidance for the number.\\nThere is reason to think this will work. Apple stopped reporting iPhone unit sales in 2019 after growth flattened. Instead, it pushed investors to look at revenue — where higher prices made up for lower unit sales. The nudge was successful.\\nBut Netflix is banking on high revenue growth that is not certain. In November, it will launch an ad-supported subscription tier. At $6.99 per month it is less than half the price of the ad-free rate and cheaper than rival services. The hope is that this will erase the damage done by two consecutive quarters of subscription declines earlier this year. But Netflix risks cannibalising its own users and lowering average revenue per user in the process.\\nNetflix claims its rivals are in worse shape: collectively losing $10bn a year. But its high-handed dismissal of the competition has not convinced investors. In the third quarter, subscriptions rose by 2.4mn . A return to growth lifted the share price 13 per cent in after-hours trading — though it remains down on the year and is still underperforming the wider S&P 500.\\nNetflix carved out a new sector in streaming services, upending cable television. For a comparatively small monthly fee, users get access to high-quality shows, unburdened by adverts and TV schedules. Over time it has gathered 223mn subscribers, become a global brand and won Oscars. But it has also attracted a host of imitators that have chipped away at growth.\\nSome of the panic around subscriptions is unfair. Subscriber losses followed a record 37mn additions in 2020. Churn makes sense. Despite big content creation plans, free cash flow is positive.\\nBut Netflix lacks the alternative revenue stream that a rival such as Disney can lean on. Adding advertising revenue is welcome, though Netflix is entering just as Disney makes the same move and the digital advertising market is in a downturn. Still, if Netflix could add $2bn in advertising revenue (half the sum Morgan Stanley expects Disney and Netflix to make between them) plus another $2bn from subscribers on the new ad-supported tier (equal to about 10 per cent of ad-free subscribers) it would lift 2024 revenues above $41.5bn and return growth to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels.\\nThese are optimistic estimates. The more gloomy forecast is that Netflix encourages existing subscribers to move to the lower tier and fails to win many new joiners.

       "  (Document(text='\\nRichard Waters\\nIs there anywhere you won’t soon be assaulted by digital advertising?\\nUber this week revealed that it is about to serve up “journey ads” when you hail a ride — commercial messages linked to your destination that appear on your phone, and maybe in future on a screen in the back of the car. About to take an international flight? A duty-free store can sponsor your entire trip to the airport.\\nMeanwhile, Netflix has just set early November for the launch of its new advertising tier, a reduced-price streaming service in 12 countries for people willing to sit through an average of five adverts an hour. True, this is an optional new service, so no one will be forced to watch advertising — but as the economic downturn bites, it might be the only realistic way for many people to keep streaming.\\nUber and Netflix are far from the only ones to latch on to advertising as a new source of revenue. Delivery apps, ecommerce marketplaces, mass market retailers, gaming services: it seems nowhere these days is commercial-free.\\nThere are obvious reasons for this stampede into the digital ads business. When audience attention shifts wholesale to new services and channels, advertising dollars inevitably follow. The rise of streaming represents a serious threat to the linear TV model that still accounts for almost all of the $170bn in global TV advertising each year.\\nHigh-margin advertising dollars, euros and pounds are also gravy for companies in industries where profit margins are thin or non-existent. For a lossmaking delivery app like DoorDash, which handled $13bn worth of orders in the latest quarter, channelling so much buying power creates an obvious opportunity. Apps like this are in a perfect position to step in front of retailers and restaurants to suggest things their users might want to buy.\\nRetail media networks are also starting to take off, as merchants like Walmart and Target collect valuable data about shoppers’ habits that advertisers can use to hone their campaigns, either on the retailers’ own sites or on other networks. Walmart disclosed the size of its advertising business for the first time earlier this year, with 2021 revenue of $2.1bn.\\nBut if there are good reasons for these and other companies to turn to advertising, there is one overriding factor that is driving the shift: the unmet demands of advertisers. Some of the targeting methods that have shaped the digital advertising industry for its entire history are breaking down.\\nApple’s decision to let its users choose if they want to be tracked has been a seismic event, robbing advertisers of valuable data. The second shoe to drop will be Google’s long-delayed plan to end support for cookies in its Chrome browser, pulling away the main support for behavioural targeting.\\nRecommended\\nThis is starting to shake the duopoly that has dominated the digital advertising world for the past 15 years. Google and Meta generated a combined $325bn of advertising revenue last year, a huge slice of a total market that Zenith media put at $405bn.\\nThe search for new forms of targeting means any business with a significant reserve of first party data — information about its own customers that can be freely used for honing advertising — could be well-placed. As advertising analyst Eric Seufert puts it: these days, everything’s an ad network.\\nNetflix, for one, has relatively little insight into its users, and will only require people signing up or its ad-supported tier to provide some basic personal information. But there will still be ways to enhance this, according to Chad Engelgau, CEO of data broking company Acxiom: Advertisers will be able to bring their own data to bear as well, refining their understanding of viewers.\\nIn this new world, the companies with the best data and the biggest audiences and user bases should win. Apple, which is taking advantage of the shifting demand for mobile advertising created by its privacy changes to expand its own advertising business, has more than 1bn iPhone users. Amazon’s insight into the buying histories and intentions of its users has already enabled it to build an advertising business that pulled in $31.2bn last year.\\nThese giants will be in the strongest position to take on Google and Facebook. But there are many behind them for whom advertising is about to become a serious revenue stream. Whatever the next 15 years in the advertising business looks like, it won’t be like the last 15.\\nrichard.waters@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/accf6e75-65b4-4be3-93df-7b3dfb3ef06f', 'title': 'Ad infinitum: companies to unleash a deluge of digital marketing', 'publication_time': '2022-10-20T17:33:21.355Z'}, uuid=UUID('cb001bab-5bc4-4274-a44f-80cbf5ea3ea2'), db_id=''),\n",

Two-thirds of its $120bn in annual revenue comes from “dumb pipes” — broadband and mobile phone service that collectively have more than 30mn customers. Wall Street has, however, turned sour on that business as subscriber additions have turned negative and the capital costs remain high.\\nThe Philadelphia-based company also has broadcaster NBCUniversal, which produces and distributes film and TV, along with several pay-TV networks such as CNBC and Bravo. The networks are bleeding subscribers as cable and satellite television become less popular.\\nThe 80 per cent fall in the share price of AMC, a pure-play listed cable business, in the past five years suggests investors don’t love those trends. But spinning off its cable networks would rid Comcast of an albatross.\\nComcast’s upstart streaming offering, Peacock, is a more intriguing prospect. Its subscribers soared this year to 36mn, helped by NBC’s coverage of the Olympics. But its losses remain massive, at nearly $1bn so far this year. Comcast management says it is open to “partnerships” for Peacock — a nod to the brutal economics of internet-first video.\\nWith a hands-off Trump administration, Peacock could seek to merge with a rival such as Paramount Plus or Warner Bros Discovery’s Max — something the Biden regime might have frowned on. Warner boss David Zaslav said on Thursday that the White House changeover offered an opportunity to consolidate that would “provide a real positive and accelerated impact on this industry that’s needed”.\\nComcast, like rival Walt Disney, has at least had a theme parks division to prop it up while figuring out how to deliver content profitably.

Until recently, streamers had avoided live sports, largely due to the high costs of rights, and technical challenges. The FT’s Josh Noble looks at what’s driving the trend, and the impact it could have.\\nProduced by FT Studios\\nYou can enable subtitles (captions) in the video player\\nIn July this year, the NBA announced a blockbuster new media rights deal worth $76bn over 11 years. As part of that deal, Amazon will pay the NBA $1.8bn per year to screen a selection of live games in the US and internationally. It's just another example of the way streaming platforms are pushing into live sport globally. Amazon has other deals to show the UEFA Champions League, the NFL, and the French Open tennis tournament.\\nApple TV+ carries Major League Baseball matches in the US, and has global rights to Major League Soccer. Last year YouTube began showing NFL matches through a seven-year contract worth $14bn. And earlier this year Netflix announced it would be screening live WWE wrestling for $500mn a year from 2025.\\nUntil recently, streamers had often avoided live sports, largely due to the high costs of rights and technical challenges involved. But the technology has improved to the point where former sticking points, such as picture quality and time lag, are now acceptable to many fans. And while expensive, live sports are a powerful way of targeting multiple demographic segments and driving new subscriptions. Ad revenues are also becoming an increasingly important component of streamers' income. And few things can attract advertisers like live sporting events.\\nFor the sports leagues, streamers have a global reach that is particularly attractive. Netflix alone has more than 270mn subscribers worldwide. But traditional broadcasters are fighting back.\\nEarlier this year, Fox, Disney, and Warner Bros announced the launch of a new streaming platform, Venu Sports. Although the venture is tied up in the legal challenge, alleging it is anticompetitive. Those three companies own 55 per cent of US sports rights. Meanwhile, in the UK, Sky Sports launched a new streaming service this summer to run alongside its traditional broadcast platform.\\nAnother challenge for streamers is that their interest in sports rights has helped drive up prices. For example, between 2019 and 2024, the value of the US sports rights market grew by 54 per cent, compared to an overall TV industry revenue growth of just 15 per cent. While streamers' spending on sports rights has soared recently, that explosive growth may ease off in the coming years, not least because many of the major sports rights deals still have years to run before renewal.

       "  (Document(text='\\nAnna Nicolaou\\nWall Street is catching up with something that has been well known inside the music industry for some time now: the streaming growth spurt is over.\\nThe sirens began to sound late last month when industry leader Universal Music revealed that streaming revenue growth had slowed considerably in the last quarter. Chief executive Lucian Grainge urged investors to focus on the long term, while chief financial officer Boyd Muir said he was “not overly concerned”. Nonetheless, the news landed with a thud, slicing UMG’s market valuation by more than 20 per cent in a single day.\\nWhat is strange about the market reaction is that other warning signs have been around for more than a year. Last October, Universal Music announced a “cost savings” programme. It has laid off hundreds of staff in recent months. Way back in March of 2023, rival Warner Music laid off 4 per cent of staff, and this February it declared plans to fire another 10 per cent.\\nEarlier this year, the chief executive of one large music company described the industry mood as “a hangover” after several years of roaring growth.\\nUniversal’s recent results were not all bad. The company behind Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish still managed to increase revenue by 9 per cent in the quarter. Ironically, the slowdown in streaming was offset by a strong showing for “physical music”, because superfans are lapping up vinyls.\\nBut Wall Street is focused on streaming, and for good reason. Revenue from streaming makes up half of Universal Music’s total business. Spotify is what saved the industry, reversing decades of industry decline. As more and more people signed up for music streaming services in the past several years, UMG and its rivals have enjoyed streaming revenue growth of 20 per cent or higher. Streaming has brought renewed interest from the world’s largest investors — the likes of Blackstone and KKR — to the music business, and made some billionaires, such as Sir Len Blavatnik, even richer.\\nUniversal’s market correction is a re-pricing of expectations for the entire industry, and probably a reasonable one. For the past several years big banks have doled out effusively optimistic projections for the music business. But Spotify is no longer new, and the market for streaming in the US has long saturated. There are many more millions of subscribers to be found across the globe, but a lot of that growth is coming from markets like India, where people pay a fraction of the price of a subscription in the West.\\nUniversal executives appeared to blame Apple and Amazon for the recent slowdown. On an earnings call, Muir said that while Spotify and YouTube Music have “continued to exhibit healthy growth\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009other large partners\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009have seen a slowdown in new subscriber additions”.\\nAmazon’s music service, in particular has flatlined, according to sources, after receiving a boost during the pandemic.\\nUniversal and its peers are working to try and reignite growth. They have spent much of this year plotting a “superfan” offering on Spotify and other streaming platforms, that would charge the most ravenous fans more money in exchange for perks such as early access to music or merchandise. Universal hopes to roll this out this year.\\nUniversal executives believe that as much as 20 per cent of Spotify’s subscribers could sign up for this super-premium offering, which Spotify chief Daniel Ek has said could cost $17 or $18 a month — up to 50 per cent more than an existing subscription. “We are at the beginning of the next phase, part two phase of streaming and subscription,” Grainge told investors. “It’s a whole suite of products”.\\nThe sky is not falling. Music companies remain in a more desirable position than legacy television and movie studios, who are still in the midst of a painful, industry-wide restructuring. Universal has told investors it will continue to deliver “high single digit” revenue growth. On Wednesday, Warner Music reported streaming revenue growth of 5.5 per cent in the last quarter.\\nMarket corrections happen. Netflix experienced one in 2022 when it became clear that the streamer was entering a more mature stage. The stock price has since climbed back up. Grainge will be hoping for a similar turnaround. Next month, Universal Music is hosting its first investor day since going public in 2021, at the legendary Abbey Road studio in London. It is a chance for the company to convince Wall Street that the music industry can thrive in this next phase.\\nanna.nicolaou@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/4b746304-d67f-404f-9357-89b4459dd7f7', 'title': 'The music industry is suffering from a streaming hangover', 'publication_time': '2024-08-08T04:00:55.054Z'}, uuid=UUID('3c088548-9dc9-4745-b4d2-994df6cd1958'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text=\"\\nDaniel Thomas and Camilla Hodgson in London\\nAmazon’s Prime Video is undercutting rival Netflix on advertising pricing, as it battles for marketers’ attention in an increasingly crowded field of ad-funded streaming services.\\nAmazon introduced advertising to its Prime Video platform five months ago and is going through its first “up front” — when television companies present their plans to advertisers to attract money over the next year.\\nThe Seattle-based company has joined a highly competitive market for ad-supported streaming services . Most rival platforms — including Netflix, Max, Paramount+ and Disney+ — have brought in an ad-supported tier at a lower price than subscriptions that carry no ads.\\nAnalysts expect Apple to bring ads to its streaming TV+ service soon too. More conventional TV companies are also offering ad-supported streaming services, while Fox’s Tubi only offers shows backed by ads.\\nThe “bundles” that advertisers buy — in different formats and with various services attached — can make direct comparisons difficult. But multiple executives at rival services, as well as advertising bosses, said Amazon was pricing its spots more cheaply than Netflix, although at a higher rate than others such as Disney.\\nThe arrival of Amazon had already forced rivals to reduce their own pricing, according to advertising sources. One rival executive noted Amazon’s “vast supply of inventory”, adding: “There is downward pressure. They knew what they were doing in terms of flipping everybody over into the tier.”\\nAmazon and Netflix declined to comment.\\nAmazon’s arrival has particularly worried executives at rival streamers because of its existing strength in retail that analysts expect will fuel interest in its Prime ad slots.\\nThe ecommerce giant automatically converted all its more than 200mn total global subscribers to the ad tier — unless they actively chose to pay more for the premium ad-free service. That meant Amazon immediately had a huge audience with which to lure advertisers.\\nIt was a “pretty dramatic and contrarian move” and had resulted in a “sudden accumulation of an advertising audience, which is pretty powerful”, said Jonathan Carson, chief executive of industry data provider Antenna.\\nThe company has a vast trove of shopper data and the ability to direct viewers to its online stores.\\nOne US TV executive said competition had noticeably increased since Amazon’s entry, adding that Prime Video ads had “made a big impact”.\\nAmazon has rapidly grown its multibillion-dollar advertising business — driven by ads on its online stores — which generated $11.8bn in sales in the first quarter of 2024, up from $9.5bn in the year-ago period.\\nAnalysts at JPMorgan said in June that the division was Amazon’s “fastest-increasing revenue stream and one of its highest-margin businesses”.\\nThe arrival of Prime Video ads was likely to propel that growth, analysts expect. Citi estimated in January that Prime Video adverts could generate more than $5bn in “high-margin advertising revenue” as it builds up, albeit a figure still substantially below the $19bn Amazon invested in video and music content in 2023.\\nBaird analysts in May said they had seen “healthy demand from both traditional linear and streaming video advertisers” for the new Prime Video ad slots. This year was “the soft rollout of Prime streaming ads” with a “bigger step-up” expected in 2025, Baird said.\\nChief executive Andy Jassy has said he believes that Prime Video can be “a large and profitable business on its own”.\\nAdvertising executives said Amazon offered brands the chance to target specific audiences thanks to the data it has from its retail platform.\\nPrime Video adverts were “the perfect closed loop attribution that we’ve been waiting for on linear TV” because “Amazon knows who you are” and what a viewer has bought on the Amazon.com website, said Citi analyst Ron Josey. “It’s a very large opportunity for them.”\\nIn May, Amazon announced “shoppable” ad formats for Prime Video to allow viewers to add products to their Amazon shopping cart during ad breaks using their smart TV remotes.\\nOne ad executive said that every brand was interested in “higher efficiency and more targeting” — both of which were being offered by Amazon.\\nHasbro adopted Prime Video advertising for a six-week test run in the UK, using Amazon first-party data to target parents. It found that two-thirds of Peppa Pig purchases during that period were new to the brand, adding that sales for those toy products on Amazon had increased 18 per cent, year on year.\\n“There is a sales pitch which has a buy one buy all, but when you get into it it's not quite there yet,” said another ad exec, pointing to the range of retail and video options as well as Twitch, the gaming platform. “But they will get there.”\\nAccording to Antenna’s Carson, the number of Prime subscribers who paid to opt out of ads was pretty substantial at first but quickly “trailed off”. At the end of May, less than a tenth had paid more for no advertising, they found.\\nOther streamers are also having success on their ad-supported tiers as cost-conscious consumers look at how many subscriptions they can maintain. Netflix has said that it has 40mn monthly active users globally on its ad tier, attracting between 40-50 per cent of new sign-ups.\\nAd plans had gone from 28 per cent to 38 per cent of the premium streaming market in the past two years, and made up more than half of gross additions for the first time in the last quarter of 2023, and first of 2024, according to Antenna.\\nThe focus on bolstering Prime Video’s financials marked a change from how Amazon had originally conceived of the streaming service, former company insiders said, seen at one time as a way to get consumers to sign up for the Prime subscription service.\\nAmazon’s Prime Video and Studios divisions were among those hit by lay-offs this year as the company sought to cut costs across the board and after big spending on blockbuster shows such as the Lord of the Rings series.\\nBut analysts and ad executives say there is more than enough content on Prime — new and old — to ensure that Amazon can take a dominant position in the market for advertising for streamers.\\n“It’s their playbook. Amazon has always been like a company that builds massive market share, then they monetise it,” said one ad executive. “You see they did that with ecommerce. They did that with cloud computing, and they’re now doing it with their ads business.”\", metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/d45c4153-6c11-4f1e-9009-62f8adf5ac2b', 'title': 'Amazon Prime Video undercuts rival Netflix on advertising prices', 'publication_time': '2024-07-30T04:00:28.402Z'}, uuid=UUID('b88e1228-f0fe-45f8-8335-0fb4acd247a7'), db_id=''),\n",

Now it needs to win the advertising one.\\xa0That will be easier said than done.\\nThe company remains the undisputed leader in video streaming. Last week, it threw up another big quarter of subscriber and revenue growth, adding more than 8mn net new subscribers from April to June. Revenue rose 17 per cent to $9.6bn while net income jumped by nearly a third.\\nFuelling the growth was last year’s decision to crack down on password sharing and introduce a lower-priced subscriber plan with advertising. Hit shows such as Bridgerton and Baby Reindeer also helped attract viewers.\\nAt a time when rival streaming services are struggling to gain customers and make a profit, Netflix , with its 27 per cent operating margin and robust free cash flows, is the envy of the sector. Its shares have traded accordingly. The stock, up 35 per cent over the past 12 months, hit a new high this month. At about 30 times forward earnings, it commands a premium over rival streaming operators.\\nBut the subscriber surge from the password crackdown cannot last. User growth will slow. This could come as soon as the next quarter, with tougher comparatives from last year. Netflix plans to stop reporting quarterly subscriber numbers starting next year.\\nIt’s a questionable move that may backfire. Without insight into subscriber growth, investors will be forced to focus on other metrics. Netflix will need to start making more money from advertising to maintain its share price gains.\\nThe problem is Netflix is still a minnow in advertising. While YouTube and Amazon have well-oiled ad machines, Netflix is only starting to build its own ad-tech platform. Analysts at Emarketer forecast Netflix will generate $760mn in advertising revenue this year. That would translate into just a 2.7 per cent market share of the so-called connected TV ad business. Hulu and YouTube each have 12 per cent, while Amazon has 11 per cent.\\nNetflix’s cheaper, ad-supported tier has over 40mn global monthly active users. It needs to work harder to monetise these customers. That means showing more ads, or even introducing ads to its other ad-free tiers. At Amazon’s Prime Video, showing ads is the default mode. Customers have to pay more to avoid ads.\\nBut people pay for Amazon Prime for free delivery. Video is just gravy. Netflix customers will have less tolerance for ads, and for being asked to pay more to stay ad-free.

Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said that achieving scale in the ad business had taken longer than expected, especially given Netflix’s “wealth of data on viewing attitudes and habits”. “It is up against even bigger tech giants with a huge base and scale,” he said, mentioning Amazon, Meta and Google. “This is clearly taking Netflix a lot longer given its small ad base.”\\nNetflix has been adding one-off sports events to its programming, including a golf tournament, an upcoming fight featuring Mike Tyson and two American football games at Christmas — leading Wall Street to ask whether it would sign a deal with a sports league.\\nTed Sarandos, co-chief executive, threw cold water on the idea of a big sports contract. “It’s very difficult to have big-league sports and profit when you have entire seasons,” he said. “Making these Netflix [sports] events, we’re not taking on a lot of tonnage.

But streaming services allow media companies to see what customers are watching and how much advertising they are exposed to.\\nMBC’s streaming bet is also helped by demographics: more than 55 per cent of the Middle East and north Africa’s population are under 30, compared with 36 per cent across OECD countries.

To meet these expectations, Shahid is funding local talent as well as recruiting foreign producers and directors to make content.\\nBarnett described management’s approach to making new programmes as “constructively paranoid about everything”, adding that to try to keep spending at reasonable levels “I have all the creatives in the room, and then I sit them down with the accountants. And we have difficult meetings.”\\nThat approach appears to be working. Shahid lost SR6mn in the first three months of this year, but the figure is improving as subscription and advertising revenues rise. Losses for the same period last year were SR102mn. At the same time, revenues rose 72 per cent year on year to SR298mn, boosted by Ramadan falling in the first quarter. Families traditionally tune in to month-long TV series during that time, making it a top period for advertising spending.\\nKarim Sarkis, a media and entertainment specialist at consultancy Strategy&, said Shahid’s free streaming service and Arabic-language shows and films are helping it compete with Netflix.\\nThose anticipating that Netflix would commission large amounts of Arabic language content have been disappointed, Sarkis said, while “MBC have also woken up in the meantime\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009if they continue competing in the same way\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009I think the [long term] winner is going to be Shahid”.\\nFounded in London in 1991 as the Arab world’s first private satellite channel, the Middle East Broadcasting Corporation was an unusual commercial player in a regional media industry dominated by state-owned networks — that are crucial for projecting soft power — and billionaires’ vanity projects.\\nIts recent history has had TV-worthy moments of drama. In November 2017, founder and chair Waleed bin Ibrahim Al Ibrahim was caught up in an anti-corruption campaign orchestrated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, where hundreds of members of Saudi Arabia’s elites were detained in the Ritz-Carlton hotel and forced to transfer cash and assets to the government.\\nFollowing the incident, Ibrahim’s ownership fell from 100 to 40 per cent of the company while an investment company owned by the finance ministry took the other 60 per cent. It sold a part of that stake in an initial public offering last year and since the listing, MBC’s share price is up about 30 per cent to SR44.\\nThe government still owns more than half of MBC’s shares but Ibrahim retained the chairmanship and is actively involved in the business. Barnett said: “Like many big media moguls, he has strong opinions on content.”\\nGauging which shows will work is critical, Barnett said. Many countries in the region have strict content rules and some streamers have been rebuked by regional regulators for showing scenes such as same-sex kissing. In 2019, Netflix was forced to remove an episode of a comedy show after a complaint by Saudi Arabia, adding to concerns about political interference.\\nMBC and Shahid try “to approach the line, but not fall over it so you are alienating your audiences”, Barnett said, citing this year’s Kuwaiti drama Zawja Waheda La Takfi ( One Wife Is Not Enough ), which tackled the subject of polygamy.\\nBut some of Shahid’s original content has caused controversy. A mini-series on the 1988 hijacking of a Kuwaiti aircraft was pulled in response to protests from the country’s information ministry. The streamer also delayed showing a major television series in early 2021, based on the true story of a Saudi drug trafficker, after his tribe said it was insulting.\\nBeyond content, Shahid has tried to cater to the large and often multigenerational families in the region by allowing up to 20 devices to connect to each subscription.\\n“We are trying to establish what’s the right balance, because like all streamers, we also see abuse of password sharing,” said Natasha Matos-Hemingway, chief commercial, marketing and product officer of Shahid. However, “we’d be hurt very badly if we were to reduce [device allowances] to like two or three”.', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/c20b3bbc-b3a7-46c0-91ea-88e60501d922', 'title': 'How Saudi Arabia’s MBC came to dominate Middle East streaming', 'publication_time': '2024-07-07T04:00:28.440Z'}, uuid=UUID('eb970a10-bda2-415d-952d-35c3eeb1b3db'), db_id=''),\n",

It will launch in the coming weeks.\\nThese will include shows from US entertainment giants such as Disney, NBCUniversal and Sony Pictures, as well as its original content and productions from large, overseas markets in India and Nigeria.\\nThe move comes months after Murdoch’s existing TV service in the UK, TalkTV, which is owned by his News UK operations, closed its linear TV operations for a digital-only platform.\\nFox Corp bought Tubi in a $440mn deal overseen by chief executive Lachlan Murdoch in 2020. It has become one of the fastest growing streamers in the US, offering viewers a video on-demand service without the need to register or subscribe.\\nThe service is instead funded by advertising. Tubi has struck deals with the major connected TV suppliers to appear on their devices as well through mobile phones and the internet.\\nThe move comes as rivals such as Netflix, Disney and Amazon have introduced advertising to their platforms, with paid subscriptions priced at a higher level for their ad-free services.\\nRival services have been raising prices over the past year as they seek to turn growth into profits after a multiyear investment spree on content.\\nTubi has gained in popularity as a result, taking the most total viewing time in the US according to data from Nielsen in May. Tubi has nearly 80mn monthly active users, and has been particularly\\xa0popular with younger audiences.\\nAnjali Sud, chief executive of Tubi, said it was growing fast as rival streamers raised their prices but cut back on content spend. There would be “no tiers, no upsell, no registration to start watching”, she said. “Everyone should be able to watch great content.”\\nMore than 60 per cent of Tubi’s users were people who have never subscribed to a pay-TV package or who were cord-cutters — customers who have stopped paying for subscriptions.\\nThe service will offer local British content as well as shows for specific audiences interested in areas such as art house content and international TV from production houses in Bollywood and Nollywood — Indian and Nigerian shows, respectively. Tubi would provide a “more diverse experience” as a result, Sud said.\\nHowever, she acknowledged that Tubi was launching into a particularly competitive UK market, with viewers here not just served by a large selection of US streaming services but also through the free public sector broadcasters such as the BBC, ITV and Channel 4.\\nThese broadcasters — alongside Channel 5 — launched a combined free TV streaming service called Freely last month, which allows viewers to switch between live and on-demand TV for their content.\\n“Its an intensely competitive space and more so over the past year,” she said. “[But] we are feeling pretty good.”\\nThis article has been amended to remove a sentence that incorrectly stated that Fox’s news and sports programming could eventually be broadcast by Tubi', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/5b0dbae7-afb1-4521-b1cd-9ec697025133', 'title': 'Rupert Murdoch’s Fox to launch free streamer Tubi in UK', 'publication_time': '2024-07-01T23:01:13.680Z'}, uuid=UUID('a1acce11-2dc4-4081-ab7d-f5d5fb186dcc'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nRichard Waters\\nWhat do the game streaming service Twitch, music app Spotify and video streamer Max all have in common? This week, they all raised prices for at least some of their subscribers, joining what has come to feel like a stampede by digital services of all kinds in 2024 to charge more.\\nThere is no mystery behind this spate of price rises. Streaming may have become the preferred business model for large parts of the media industry, but for most it has also been chronically unprofitable — particularly in the video world, where it has put a severe dent in the multichannel TV model that was long a reliable money-spinner.\\nFor now, the pricing actions have not done much to depress subscriber numbers, encouraging some companies to push through more than one round of increases. But they signal that streaming is entering a new phase, where the headlong race for user growth is over and new forces will determine which comes out on top.\\nSpotify, founded 18 years ago, has yet to report a profitable year, while the chief executive of the 13-year-old Twitch, now a subsidiary of Amazon, also said in January that it loses money. Warner Bros Discovery, owner of Max, at least broke into the black in streaming last year, making it the first traditional media conglomerate to do so. But it made a negligible profit on more than $10bn of revenue.\\nOne notable thing about the higher subscription costs is that, at least until recently, most streamers chose to hold prices down in a race to attract users. Twitch, which raised the cost of its lowest subscription tier by 20 per cent, to $5.99 a month, had never had a price increase in the US before.\\nAfter dipping their toes in the water, though, some are starting to see price increases as a repeatable tactic. Spotify kept its subscription unchanged, at $10 a month, for more than a decade before raising it by $1 last year. This week, it announced another $1, with even bigger percentage increases for family and other premium subscription plans.\\nSpotify’s subscriber numbers have continued to rise strongly — one reason its stock price has soared fourfold since the start of last year. By 2031, Midia Research forecasts music streamers will be able to push through three more broad rounds of price increases, while also introducing new, higher-priced tiers of super-premium services.\\nTatiana Cirisano, senior music industry analyst at Midia, says music streaming has turned out to be a “stickier” service than many might have thought: subscribers tend to stay not just because of a familiar brand, but because they have spent time assembling playlists, while a service’s algorithms have learnt their preferences.\\nHigher prices are also set to usher in a new phase in the battle between digital services of all kinds. As consumers feel the pinch from paying for multiple high-priced premium services, getting a discount for buying a package of services starts to become more attractive — something that encourages the recreation of the very media bundles that standalone streaming services helped to destroy.\\nThis reflects a familiar pattern in the media business. Waves of unbundling, as old media packages are picked apart, are often followed by re-bundling. Consumers get more for a single payment — though one side-effect is that they also often end up, once again, paying for things they do not want. For media owners, meanwhile, selling a package also lowers overall customer acquisition costs and reduces churn of accounts.\\nIn video streaming, Disney has reported success with adding Hulu to its Disney+ video offering , and is planning to do the same with its ESPN+ sports service. Cross-company bundles are also in the works, with a Disney+, Hulu and Max subscription package promised for later this year.\\nAs these new media bundles start to form, new competitors will loom large. Amazon’s Prime, which combines video with free ecommerce deliveries, and Apple One, which includes six of the iPhone maker’s services, including iCloud storage, have shown Big Tech’s willingness to experiment with unconventional offerings that traditional media companies cannot match. Google has also included access to its latest AI models for some subscribers, though it has not gone as far in bundling all its subscription services together. The potential of these tech groups to combine many different types of services and to up-sell to their billions of users are likely to make them formidable competitors in the next phase of the streaming wars.\\nrichard.waters@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/e77d07d8-2997-40f3-b3ba-3577fb097368', 'title': 'The next phase of the streaming wars', 'publication_time': '2024-06-06T16:44:43.216Z'}, uuid=UUID('2ec35213-aa42-4a3e-bdac-c78d0a244251'), db_id=''),\n",

Controlling shareholder Shari Redstone favours a deal with David Ellison’s Skydance over joint interest from Sony and Apollo, pitting her against minority shareholders and prompting the departure of the CEO. But it also shows the climax is approaching in a longer-running industry drama. The likely sale of Paramount marks it out as the first big casualty of the streaming wars. It may not be the last.\\nWhen companies followed Netflix into streaming, market entry was straightforward. Technology companies like Apple leveraged their existing customer bases to lure subscribers, while venerated studios such as Warner Brothers built platforms for their intellectual property. All players used their existing profitable business lines — specifically cable TV for the media companies — and the favourable borrowing environment to finance flashy films and series.\\nThe road to profitability, however, has been more winding. Initial streaming losses were seen as an investment in market share. But streaming has also killed media companies’ golden goose, as consumers have “cut the cord” of cable TV in favour of subscriptions. In a rush to gain market share, Paramount, Warner Bros, and NBCUniversal have poured billions into streaming. With interest rates higher, subscriber growth slowing, and streaming losses mounting, Wall Street has now turned up the pressure on Hollywood.\\nDespite its ownership of marquee franchises such as The Godfather and Mission Impossible — which makes its studio attractive to buyers — Paramount has been weakened by the decline of cable and the billions it has invested into its late entrant into the streaming wars, Paramount+. The group’s debt rating was cut to junk by S&P in March. The fate of the subscale Paramount+ in any takeover is unclear. But other legacy media giants that have spent big on streaming platforms without turning profits may also now have to consider merging or selling them.\\nConsolidation has long been seen as inevitable in an crowded streaming market, but has its downsides. Hollywood is famous for its monopolistic tendencies, and having fewer players could further squeeze actors and writers, who went on strike last summer. Reorganisation may hasten the shrinking of the industry, pushing more people out of Tinseltown. It also threatens to lead to narrower choice and less abundant top-quality content for consumers, who have already seen streaming prices rise.\\nFor now, according to analysts, the smaller streaming players are trying to emulate the most successful, Netflix, by introducing new advertising tiers and by bulking up their content libraries. But with financial conditions drying up, spending across streaming has slowed from its Covid heyday. Streamers have started commissioning fewer titles and ordering a higher proportion of cheaper unscripted series, including reality shows and sports documentaries.\\nThey are also relying on existing IP to fill their content coffers, as buying popular franchises bears less financial risk than new commissions. Many critics have long lamented film studios’ overreliance on franchises. But as shown by Disney’s acquisition of Fox, Amazon’s purchase of MGM, and now the questions over what happens to Paramount+, the future of streaming may also be sequels and spin-offs.\\nThis highlights a new evolution in the streaming wars: streamers seem set to start looking more like the cable TV they displaced. Viewers were initially drawn to the likes of Netflix by the promise of advertisement-free original content.

Under pressure to stem losses, entertainment companies are opting to sell more of their content to Netflix. By waiting out its rivals, Netflix has eclipsed them.\\nIt has done this through a vast, debt-fuelled expansion followed by concerted cost cutting. When entertainment companies first competed in streaming they began by hoarding their most popular TV shows and films. The loss of shows like Friends put pressure on Netflix to build up its own back catalogue. It expanded into reality TV, romcoms and international series while handing over large sums of money to well-known showrunners such as Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy. By 2021, annual content spend in cash terms exceeded $17bn.\\nThe price Netflix paid for all that content was falling margins and a heavy debt load that exceeds $14bn. While the pandemic added millions of new subscribers, competition and subscription fatigue led to a subsequent dip in 2022. Netflix’s operating margin dropped sharply from 21 per cent to 18 per cent. The company’s market cap traded below Disney’s.\\nBy focusing on operating margins, Netflix has staged a comeback . It has cracked down on password sharing, promoted an advertising-supported subscription tier and raised prices.\\nBut the real change has come from cost cutting, aided by a writers’ strike in Hollywood that halted productions. While revenue rose 6.6 per cent in 2023, net income rose 20 per cent. Not only has the operating margin recovered but chief financial officer Spencer Neumann is predicting a margin of up to 24 per cent this year — a new high for the company.\\nCompare Netflix with Disney and Netflix comes out ahead, as its market cap now indicates. Disney’s direct-to-consumer unit, which includes streaming service Disney+, is still reporting large operating losses. Activist investor Nelson Peltz says Disney’s streaming service should target “ Netflix-like margins ” of 15 to 20 per cent. This might be achieved by cutting back on content spend and licensing more content — two moves that would further serve Netflix.\\xa0Dearth of new content elsewhere may explain why Netflix is still adding new subscribers.\\nFor Netflix, this may still be a partial victory. Streaming remains an expensive business with low revenue per subscriber. YouTube is more popular than any streaming service and much of its content is created for free by users. Its revenue is mainly advertising, with subscriptions a bonus.

The price is a steep increase over Raw’s current deal with Comcast’s USA Network.\\nMore importantly, this marks Netflix’s plunge into pricey live programming, an area it had long eschewed. News and sports had been the only content that kept traditional “linear” television afloat as a business model.

Netflix is betting that moment has arrived.\\nNetflix has struck the Raw deal from a position of relative strength. Its shares are well below the all-time high prices hit in 2021 but have more than doubled from its trough. Subscriber growth has returned as it has cracked down on password sharing. Its operating margin is now at 20 per cent on the back of its new value tier which includes advertising.\\nDepending on the year, Netflix spends around $15bn on acquiring programming.

Amazon Prime has also invested in Major League Baseball rights.\\nShares in TKO jumped by 15 per cent on Tuesday, implying a market value gain of $2bn.

She has held talks about selling the Hollywood studio to Skydance, the production company behind Top Gun: Maverick , people familiar with the matter say.\\nParamount chief executive Bob Bakish also discussed a possible combination over lunch with Warner CEO David Zaslav in mid-December. In both cases the discussions were said to be at an early stage and people familiar with the talks cautioned that a deal might not materialise.\\nBeyond their streaming losses, the traditional media groups are facing a weak advertising market, declining television revenues and higher production costs following the Hollywood strikes .\\nRich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners, said Paramount’s deal discussions were a reflection of the “complete and utter panic” in the industry.\\n“TV advertising is falling far short, cord-cutting is continuing to accelerate, sports costs are going up and the movie business is not performing,” he said. “Everything is going wrong that can go wrong. The only thing [the companies] know how to do to survive is try to merge and cut costs.”\\nBut as the traditional media owners struggle, Netflix, the tech group that pioneered the streaming model more than a decade ago, has emerged as the winner of the battle to reshape video distribution.\\n“For much of the past four years, the entertainment industry spent money like drunken sailors to fight the first salvos of the streaming wars,” Michael Nathanson, an analyst MoffettNathanson, wrote in November. “Now, we are finally starting to feel the hangover and the weight of the unpaid bar bill.”\\nFor companies that have been trying to compete with Netflix, Nathanson added, “the shakeout has begun”.\\nAfter a bumpy 2022, Netflix has set itself apart from rivals — most notably by being profitable. Earnings for its most recent quarter soared past Wall Street’s expectations as it added 9mn new subscribers — the strongest rise since early 2020, when Covid-19 lockdowns led to a jump.\\n“Netflix has pulled away,” says John Martin, co-founder of Pugilist Capital and former chief executive of Turner Broadcasting. For its rivals, he said, the question is “how do you create a viable streaming service with a viable business model? Because they’re not working.”\\nThe leading streaming services aggressively raised prices in 2023. Now, analysts, investors and executives predict consolidation could be ahead next year as some of the smaller services combine or bow out of the streaming wars.\\nWarner, home to HBO and the Warner Bros movie studio, has made a small profit at its US streaming services this year, in part by raising prices, aggressively culling some series and licensing others to Netflix. However, this has come at a price: Warner lost more than 2mn streaming subscribers in its two most recent quarters.\\nThe company, which merged with rival Discovery last year, has long been rumoured as a potential takeover candidate, with Comcast seen as the most likely buyer. But Zaslav in November hinted that his group wanted to be an acquirer instead of a target.\\n“There are a lot of\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009excess players in the market. So, this will give us a chance not only to fight to grow in the next year, but to have the kind of balance sheet and the kind of stability\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009that we could be really opportunistic over the next 12 to 24 months,” he said on an earnings call.\\nThe terms of the Warner-Discovery merger barred the group from dealmaking for two years. That period expires on April 8.\\nDisney, the largest traditional media company, is in the midst of a gutting restructuring that has featured 7,000 job cuts and attacks from activist investors. It lost more than $1.6bn from its streaming businesses in the first nine months of 2023, during which its Disney+ service gained 8mn subscribers. The company says it will turn a profit in streaming in late 2024.\\nBob Iger, Disney chief executive, this year openly pondered whether some of its assets still fit within the company, prompting speculation that he was considering disposals. But no deals emerged, leading some investors to conclude there is little appetite among private equity or tech companies for acquiring legacy businesses.\\nParamount’s shares have risen almost 40 per cent since early November as sale speculation mounted. The stock rose sharply after the Skydance talks were reported, but both Paramount and Warner shares fell after news of their discussions came to light.\\nAnalysts said the two companies’ high debt levels were an immediate concern for investors. “We suspect investors will focus on pro forma leverage above all else,” Citi analysts wrote in a note last week. They estimated that an all-stock combination of Warner and Paramount could yield at least $1bn of synergies.\\nBut Greenfield said merging two companies with lossmaking streaming services and large portfolios of declining television assets was not the answer to their problems.\\n“The right answer should be, let’s stop trying to be in the streaming business,” he said. “The answer is, let’s get smaller and focused and stop trying to be a huge company. Let’s dramatically shrink.”', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/ec0f7996-fae9-4e80-baa9-020ad470c25a', 'title': '‘Shakeout has begun’ after $5bn streaming loss for Netflix rivals', 'publication_time': '2023-12-28T05:00:11.030Z'}, uuid=UUID('96396fd8-c933-4c42-8b8d-3bb22956c7b5'), db_id=''),\n",

Writers and actors demanded better royalties when their shows performed well on streaming services, just as they had done on traditional television networks.\\nBut success-based payments required more information about streaming services’ performance measures. Talent agents and Hollywood unions said Netflix kept that information closely guarded — in contrast with the public releases of Nielsen ratings for traditional TV.\\nSarandos said the new data releases were not driven by the strikes but should create “a better environment for the [Hollywood] guilds, for the producers, for creators and for the press”.\\nHe added that the information being released “is the data that we use to run the business — this is the exact same pool of data that we’re sharing”.\\nJeremy Zimmer, chief executive of the talent agency UTA, had long argued that Netflix and other streamers would have to become more transparent, and that this would be better for writers, actors and producers.\\n“Netflix has waited to release this data until the benefit was greater than the liability,” Zimmer told the Financial Times. “Nonetheless, it’s great to have it available for our clients and it will allow us to create more value on their behalf.”\\nLast year Netflix launched an advertising-based version of its streaming service, although the data release is not aimed at helping advertisers target audiences. “We use third-party reporting because that is the traditional way advertisers verify viewing for payment,” Sarandos said.\\nRecommended\\nBrian Wieser, principal at advertising consultancy Madison and Wall, said the new data is “not very usable from an advertiser perspective.”\\n“This is more useful for Hollywood in general than advertisers,” he said.\\nNetflix began disclosing more about its shows’ performance in 2021, when it started releasing its weekly Top 10 and Most Popular lists. The company said those data releases went further than any other streamer except YouTube. Now its disclosures are far more extensive.\\nSarandos said its earlier decision not to release viewership data was based on protecting information from would-be rivals.\\n“In the early days, it wasn’t really in our interest to be that transparent because we were building a new business and we needed room to learn.

Physical formats, such as CDs and vinyl albums, will recede to 13 per cent of revenue in 2027, from nearly 17 per cent in 2022, Omdia says.\\nEven as streaming services have expanded to many countries around the globe, Omdia expects North America to remain the bedrock of music spending by a wide margin.\\nThe region will account for 43.2 per cent of global recorded music buying in 2027, down only slightly from 43.9 per cent in 2022, Omdia analysts forecast. Europe will maintain its number two spot, with 27 per cent of global music spending, the consultancy adds.\\nSpotify launched a decade and a half ago, and hundreds of millions of people across the world now pay a monthly fee to stream music. The streaming pioneer reached 226mn paying subscribers at the end of September.\\nBut the early land-grab of new subscribers is slowing in some regions, leaving the music industry to find ways to keep up momentum and fuel future growth. “The days of high double-digit growth are long gone”, Omdia warns. “Developed countries all face the problem of what to do when the subscriber pool dries up”.\\nCountries to watch 2023-2027\\nUS Developments in the world’s biggest recorded-music market will flow through to the rest of the world\\nChina Leading services are adding users in increasingly significant numbers\\nBrazil Once a global top five market, recent subscription gains could signal the country’s return to the industry’s top ranks\\nIndia Despite persistently low per-capita sales, the population size means the country cannot be ignored\\nSource: FT-Omdia Digital Economies Index\\nIn the US, this slowdown has already begun. Last year, US recorded music revenue rose 6 per cent compared with the prior year, to $15.9bn, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, the trade group. This was its slowest growth rate since 2016, when the business had just begun to bounce back from its piracy-driven downturn.\\nIn the next phase of music streaming’s evolution, Omdia analysts suggest that streaming companies will need to strike a balance with pricing.\\nInvestment bank TD Cowen notes that the amount consumers spend on music relative to their other expenses is less than half of the level it reached during the 1990s. “Not only is music still relatively inexpensive; the product has also improved significantly, with streaming services offering access to a library of virtually all music ever created on easily portable devices”, says analyst Doug Creutz. Against this backdrop, he expects further price rises in the coming years.\\nGoldman Sachs analysts believe that the monetisation of music has “significantly lagged consumption” and also expect price rises “on a regular basis, especially in an environment of higher inflation”.\\nWhen Spotify launched in 2008, “the environment for recorded music sales was completely different”, says Simon Dyson, Omdia analyst. “Piracy was still horrendous. There was still lots of free music floating around. The $9.99 [price] was in line with the price of a CD.”\\nIt would take more than a decade for Spotify to raise the price of its standard subscription in the US, the world’s largest recorded music market. The streaming group announced a $1 rise in July of this year, with Americans now paying $11 a month to stream all the world’s music. Spotify said the price rise would help the company “keep innovating in changing market conditions”. Rival Apple Music last year raised the price of its music subscription to $11 a month.\\nDyson anticipates that Spotify will continue raising prices by $1 every year going forward. “It’s very underpriced for what it’s offering,” he says. “Even if they do a price rise next year and the year after, I think it will still be underpriced.”\\nEarly financial results suggest Spotify has pricing power. During the quarter when Spotify raised prices, the group still managed to sign up 6mn new subscribers, above the 4mn it had forecast. The group also turned a profit for the first time in more than a year. Chief executive and co-founder Daniel Ek said the results proved that Spotify could become a “great business”.\\n“Because of our confidence in our product and our ever-expanding content offering, we felt the timing was right to raise prices”, Ek, the 40-year-old billionaire, told investors on an earnings call.\\nOmdia analysts believe that music companies and streaming services “need to be more proactive” in offering different pricing and subscription options. At the moment, Spotify, Apple, Amazon, YouTube and others all offer a similar catalogue of songs at similar prices. Omdia expects these services will need to differentiate themselves in the same way that Netflix and video platforms do, with exclusive content.\\nSpotify has made strides towards this, making a push into podcasts and audiobooks with the goal of expanding its scope to all things audio — not just music. Spotify is even offering UK and Australia subscribers 15 hours of audiobook listening per month at no extra cost, an offer that it plans to expand to the US in the coming months.\\nHowever, Omdia analysts expect streaming companies will eventually need to split some of these offerings into different subscription tiers or add-ons. “It may seem like a good idea to increase the breadth of content to limit churn, but continuing to keep all audio content in a single silo really is a recipe for disaster,” they warn.', metadata={'query': 'Market trends in the streaming industry', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1e3c5cca-75ba-4846-8ccd-d20dc6534e06', 'title': 'North America set to keep its grip on music streaming', 'publication_time': '2023-11-06T05:30:57.575Z'}, uuid=UUID('1fa96d0b-e9a8-41b9-84ed-7548b91c7a5c'), db_id=''),\n",

Then, once the network has been created, fibre broadband tends to be cheaper to operate and maintain, including much lower energy costs.\\nAs well as being faster, fibre is also much more reliable and has lower latency — a measure of the time taken for data to travel to somewhere else on the internet and then come back. Fibre is needed for such consumer applications as 4K video streaming, augmented and virtual reality, and gaming.\\nWhile 5G mobile connections can deliver fast speeds and low latency, it compares badly with fibre connections as the need for fixed connections “to a large number of small cells negates any potential cost advantages”, says Omdia.\\nThese findings all emerge from the third edition of the Digital Economies Index published by the FT and tech research firm Omdia, which is based on 16 performance measures across 51 countries. The performance measures include the availability of internet connections, smartphones and other devices, spending on streaming and other entertainment, digital payments and corporate spending.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nThis year’s data analysis shows that the ranking of the top 10 biggest digital economies in the world is not predicted to change much over the next four years, with only Brazil moving above Canada to take ninth place. However, it does also show that some 16 countries will see compound annual growth of more than 6 per cent between now and 2027.\\nThe countries growing quickest include: India, where fibre broadband subscriptions are forecast to rise from 30mn to 71mn; Vietnam, where 5G services are expected to launch next year; and Mexico, which is predicted to leapfrog Italy, Australia and Hong Kong in size.\\nThe Omdia research also reveals how digital economies are developing in emerging markets.\\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\\nIn China, the market for music streaming has grown rapidly, as consumers have been convinced to pay for music. Meanwhile, Disney has found success in video streaming in India by teaming up with Hotstar — having discovered that local content is crucial, according to Omdia.\\nChina dominates again in the so-called ‘internet-of-things’, as it is forecast to be home to three-quarters of the world’s cellular IoT connections, when more and more household devices, such as fridges and kettles, are connected to the internet.\\nFor certain industries, though, technological change will bring disruption. For example, Omdia’s data suggests that the advertising industry is set to see more upheaval, with the demise of traditional TV advertising and the rise of retail advertising, which appears on websites and apps close to the point of sale.\\nAdvertisers’ own data will become more and more important, though, as governments and regulators impose tighter privacy rules. But the impact of macroeconomic factors on the advertising industry has become less clear-cut. Many small and medium-sized businesses have become more reliant on digital advertising, making it harder for those companies to cut back on marketing in a recession.', metadata={'query': 'Potential for increased global viewership', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/23c4d3aa-5a1b-4080-8d79-6d9726f8081d', 'title': 'Fibre broadband in emerging markets powers growth of digital economies', 'publication_time': '2023-11-06T05:30:57.543Z'}, uuid=UUID('4f1cc17c-9354-4a23-88d1-7e86c172df5b'), db_id=''),\n",
       "   \"Yes. The connection between the news and the business story lies in the growth of digital economies in emerging markets, particularly the increased demand for high-quality internet connections like fibre broadband, which supports services such as streaming. As countries like India and Mexico improve their internet infrastructures and increase fibre broadband subscriptions, the potential for streaming services like Netflix to expand their user base becomes greater.

Channel 5 really grounds us in the local market place. It gives us something different to the other US majors.

The US entertainment giant’s chief Bob Iger is considering a significant change of strategy by selling all or part of its India business.\\nDisney first entered India through a joint venture in the 1990s, when it was riding high from hits like Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast . More recently, India became a crucial part of Iger’s big bet on streaming after he acquired Rupert Murdoch’s Star television business in 2019.\\nBut Disney has recently reached out to Blackstone and other investors to gauge their interest in buying a stake in its Indian arm, according to reports confirmed by the Financial Times.\\nDisney’s potential retreat from the world’s most populous country has been somewhat lost in the long list of things Iger needs to figure out — such as finding his successor, an upcoming bill to buy out a minority stake in streaming service Hulu estimated to be at least $9bn, and the latest attack from billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz.\\nBut it speaks to a broader global retrenchment by Hollywood. Paramount, owner of the eponymous movie studio, might scrap plans to launch its streaming service in India, according to Bloomberg . Warner Bros Discovery has hinted at similar caution about launching its Max streaming service in countries such as India.\\nWBD executive JB Perrette recently told a conference in Bali that the company would partner with local distributors in markets where subscriber revenue is “just too low” or cluttered with “a ton of other players, who are\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009losing a ton of money”.\\nThis is a reversal from the prevailing thinking among US media groups just a few years ago, when they were all trying to replicate the Netflix playbook.\\nThe world outside the US was always a key part of Netflix’s strategy. As the tech company stomped into Hollywood, rattling the companies that had long run the entertainment business, Netflix executives spoke often of the importance of countries like Brazil or South Korea, where it was investing heavily in local-language fare.\\nThe strategy was to go big: spend a lot of money on making TV shows, and then beam them into televisions in hundreds of countries throughout the world. This helped justify the money they were spending. If Netflix paid $20mn to make a show, the expense was at least divided up among more subscribers.\\nThe incumbent US media groups initially tried to follow suit. But a series of challenges — such as rising interest rates, inflation, and a more impatient stock market — have led them to scale back these ambitions.\\nAs it turns out, producing television in different countries is time-consuming, expensive, and can be hard to get right. Netflix had a big advantage. It took on this task during an era when Wall Street was sympathetic to — even enthusiastic about — its heavy spending. In a sense, Squid Game and Lupin are creatures of the era of rock-bottom interest rates.\\nThe incumbents have not been afforded the same leniency. The current iteration of Hollywood is about delivering profit. It is not surprising then, that Disney is exploring options for India, where its streaming subscribers on average pay only 59 cents a month.\\nDisney has operated in India for decades but was flung deeper into the country through its blockbuster acquisition of Fox, which included Rupert Murdoch’s Star India — the TV business he and his sons had spent decades building in the fast-growing media market.\\nThis was a boon to Iger’s initial streaming push. Star India contributed a multitude of early subscribers, inflating Disney’s streaming numbers at a time when investors were obsessed with subscriber additions. But a few years later, with the market fixated on profit, these low-paying India subscribers appear less valuable. To make matters worse, Disney last year lost the rights to stream Indian Premier League cricket matches, leading millions of people to cancel their subscriptions.\\nWith Peltz pushing for “multiple” board seats at Disney, Iger is under pressure to cut costs further. Against this backdrop, losing money in India for another five years is not appealing.\\nNetflix chief executive Ted Sarandos seems to have noticed that his competition is backing away.\\xa0“When we first started doing this, I thought it was kind of unusual that about 80 per cent of television viewing around the world was US content and we’re like 5 per cent of the population,” Sarandos said at a conference last week.\\xa0But he added streaming is a “hard” business and “you have to do it at scale”. “It’s really hard for the legacy businesses to navigate that,” he said.\\nanna.nicolaou@ft.com\\n', metadata={'query': 'Potential for increased global viewership', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/3312bd87-0362-430f-be4e-502737bca34d', 'title': 'Hollywood turns inward', 'publication_time': '2023-10-19T11:49:40.165Z'}, uuid=UUID('15b37f62-8f75-4dc3-9a11-d00b79ffdda9'), db_id=''),\n",

It follows streaming rivals including Netflix and Disney+ that have also introduced ad-supported tiers this year.\\nFriday’s announcement comes as Amazon expands advertising across its products and services, which includes charging third-party sellers to promote their items on its retail store. Ads have become a fast-growing and highly profitable source of income for Amazon in recent years. Revenue from ads nearly doubled from $20bn in 2020 to $39bn in 2022.\\nIn a blog post, Amazon said Prime Video content would include “limited” adverts from early next year to enable it to continue investing in TV content and increase investment “over a long period of time”.\\nAmazon added that it aimed to have “meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers”. Customers in the US will be able to pay an extra $2.99 per month for an ad-free option; pricing for other countries have yet to be released.\\nAll Prime members will be automatically put on the ad-supported service when it comes into effect next year, unlike most other streaming apps. Amazon plans to email Prime members telling them how to sign up for the ad-free option.\\nAdvertising across Prime Video content will be introduced in the US, UK, Germany and Canada in early 2024, followed by France, Italy, Spain, Mexico, and Australia later in the year.\\nChanging the pricing model for Prime Video — one of the array of benefits bundled up in a Prime subscription, including free shipping and certain discounts — carries risks because the streaming service is less relevant to Amazon’s core business than it is for Netflix, analysts said.\\n“Prime has directly attributable revenue and costs, but it’s also an important marketing tool, and it drives increased purchasing: the real revenue from Prime is a lot more than the subscription fee,” said tech analyst Benedict Evans.\\nLarge US streaming services have come under pressure from investors to curtail profligate spending on TV and film content, which was deemed necessary in the race for subscriber growth.\\nAmazon’s Lord of the Rings spin-off, The Rings of Power , was reported to have been one of the most expensive TV shows made on a cost per episode basis.\\nBut streaming services have suffered a slowdown in subscriber numbers in key markets, given the cost of living crisis and increased competition.\\nNetflix, Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros Discovery pushed up prices to boost profitability. Many streaming services have also introduced advertising on lower-priced tiers, to create new revenue streams and offer households cheaper ways to subscribe.\\nAmazon said on Friday that it would not increase the cost of its Prime subscriptions in 2024.\\nBob Iger, Disney chief executive, said this summer that its ad-supported service, which cost $7.99 per month, had signed up 3.3mn subscribers.

The total value of European football media rights has already stagnated, according to analysts at Enders.\\n“If post-Covid inflation was factored in, we estimate that the value would be down 17 per cent on 2018-19 by 2023-24 in real terms,” they said, pointing to the competitiveness of the broadcasting market “where all indications point downwards consistent with the tepid consumer market”.\\nSome content could not load.

The Premier League’s increasing global popularity means that — unlike all other European football competitions — it already makes more money from international broadcasts than from its home market.\\nHowever, many households — in the UK and elsewhere — are seeking to reduce the amount of money spent on TV subscriptions, which is likely to weigh on bidding.\\nSky is the one of the few guaranteed bidders given how important sports rights have become to its brand. Losing a significant number of Premier League games is all but unthinkable, according to analysts.\\n“Sky might pay a premium just to keep everyone else out. They need those rights,” said the Premier League club executive.\\nBut Sky’s revenue decreased 11.5 per cent to $17.9bn last year and the company has begun to cut jobs amid a slowing advertising market.

Adding premium sports in the UK is seen by executives as important to the London-based group, but people close to DAZN say it is unlikely to want to spend significant sums.\\nThe wild cards will be the large tech companies such as Amazon, which in the last auction acquired a small package of rights. Analysts see the US ecommerce giant as likely to participate, but to focus on securing games around important retail dates, as previously.\\xa0Apple, which has been buying sports rights in the US to show globally, is seen as less likely to be interested in an expensive set of rights for a single country.\\nA DAZN spokesman said: “The UK market is of clear interest, but only if we can deliver the value and innovation that supporters want and the market needs.”\\nTNT is keen to retain premium sports rights, according to a person close to the company. When still wholly owned by BT, it had already renewed its rights to the Champions League and other Uefa competitions until 2027. Sky declined to comment.\\nPremier League officials are now looking at how to structure the auction — which could take place before the end of the year — to encourage greater bidding interest.\\nMark Oliver, of Oliver & Ohlbaum Associates, said the league’s strategy needed to “create tension” — and divide the rights into packages that incentivise broadcasters to compete against each other.\\nBut even so, he saw the price likely to be flat or slightly down. “They could get lucky if they parcel it up in the right way and get an increment of 5-10 per cent. Sky has learnt how to live with less of the Premier League, without the Champions League. TNT are probably not looking to up their bid. Amazon have elsewhere been incremental opportunists, and DAZN is the one unknown.”\\nBroadcast executives say that the most likely outcome is that the Premier League will try to push up the overall value by allowing more games to be broadcast, to gain a higher absolute price but potentially mask a fall in value of the price per game. Uefa was able to raise headline revenue from its rights auctions last year in part by increasing the number of games on offer.\\nThis was also the strategy pursued by the English Football League (EFL), which managed to increase the price of the rights by 50 per cent but only by increasing the number of fixtures fourfold to over 1,000 matches per season. Sky retained the exclusive rights for the five seasons until 2028-29 for £895mn in fees and £40mn in “marketing benefits”.\\nBroadcasters are barred from airing games at 3pm on a Saturday, so more Premier Leagues games are being shifted to Friday, Sunday and Monday.

       "  (Document(text='\\nAnna Nicolaou\\nEvery week the big cable news networks in the US — CNN, Fox News and MSNBC — blast out press releases touting some kind of ratings achievement. These documents are sometimes specific, and often ultra competitive, with each channel trying to claim the title of “most-watched” on cable.\\nRecently, this obsession with ratings has started to look a bit like musicians playing their violins as the Titanic sinks.\\xa0Cable television is in long-term decline.\\xa0Some recent statistics: every day, about 25,000 Americans cancel their cable cord. The number of US homes receiving cable TV has dwindled to about the same level as in 1992, according to MoffettNathanson, when it was still a relatively new medium.\\nIn the US, less than half of viewership of “TV” actually occurs through traditional television. It is happening, instead, on streaming services.\\xa0The erosion of pay-TV has “already gathered so much momentum that it is now uneconomical for anyone to fight the tide”, analysts at MoffettNathanson said in May. They estimate that 2.3mn Americans cut their cable cords in the first quarter.\\nThis transition has been going on for a while, but the messaging around it has become more urgent. Disney’s Bob Iger this summer casually announced that its linear TV networks “may not be core” to the business, effectively putting these channels up for sale. As head of Disney, Iger’s comments tend to shape conversations in Hollywood, and he seemed to make it official: TV is on the way out.\\nIt’s hard to reckon this backdrop with the quibbling over which cable news channel lured the most 25- to 54-year-olds on any given night.\\xa0But the answer to that question is usually Fox News, Rupert Murdoch’s network, which has fared the best of the lot. Fox News benefits from a loyal\\xa0audience, if ageing like other networks.\\nCNN, meanwhile, has suffered a steeper drop than its peers in the post-Trump media cycle, falling to a distant third place behind the left-leaning MSNBC. On average, only 463,000 people were watching CNN on any given day during the second quarter, down from 1.2mn in the same period in 2020. Among the coveted 25- to 54-year-old demographic, the numbers are more dire: only 94,513 of these people were watching CNN on an average day during the quarter.\\nThese news networks are still pulling in big profits. They make most of their money from licensing fees that cable operators pay to run their programming and — for now — these operators are still paying up. But there will probably come a time when the maths no longer adds up. All these news companies will have to transform their businesses eventually.\\nMurdoch launched “Fox Nation” as a streaming platform for Fox News five years ago, but the company has yet to reveal how many people have signed up for it. In a recently leaked video , former Fox star Tucker Carlson said that “nobody watches Fox Nation because the site sucks”. At $6 a month, Fox Nation would have to attract more than 40mn subscribers to match the $3bn in revenue that Fox News makes under the current system. Analysts estimate that Fox Nation has fewer than 2mn subscribers.\\nCNN’s problems appear more pressing. The company has had three different owners in the past six years and suffered the abrupt exit of longtime leader Jeff Zucker, who had built CNN into a ratings machine during the Trump era. His departure was followed by a brief but tumultuous stint under Chris Licht, who left after a series of controversies.\\nWarner Bros Discovery on Thursday revealed plans to stream live CNN programming on its Max platform next month. Warner is also in talks to bring in Mark Thompson, a respected news veteran who ran the BBC and the New York Times, to right the ship at CNN, according to a person familiar with the matter.\\nBut it is unclear how much WBD chief David Zaslav is willing to invest in a streaming future for CNN, which represents only a small fraction of Warner’s revenue. Warner denies that CNN is for sale, but with $45bn in net debt it is hard to imagine Zaslav would not sell if presented with a decent offer. The earliest he could do so is in April, owing to a stipulation in last year’s merger of Warner with Discovery.\\nNext year’s US presidential election provides hope for these cable news companies. But even it delivers a bump in ratings, the longer term malaise is clear.\\nanna.nicolaou@ft.com\\nThis article has been amended to correct the estimate of the number of subscribers that Fox Nation would have to attract to match the revenue Fox News makes', metadata={'query': 'Potential for increased global viewership', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/299a7544-e1b7-4c11-a3a5-53aff763bcb1', 'title': 'The damning verdict of viewers on US cable TV', 'publication_time': '2023-08-24T14:07:09.800Z'}, uuid=UUID('d8320015-d5f9-4848-acb2-07b9c47ccdf4'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nRuchir Sharma\\nThe writer is chair of Rockefeller International\\nIndia’s economy has as much entrenched rust as it has entrepreneurial dynamism. And no two industries illustrate these contradictions more clearly than its most iconic entertainments, Bollywood and cricket. Facing the same challenge — growing competition for fans in the internet age — cricket is killing it, Bollywood is blowing it.\\nCricket’s growing popularity rests on the Indian Premier League. Since its launch in 2008, the estimated value of the IPL has risen from $1.1bn to more than $15bn. This year, the two-month season drew nearly 1bn viewers from live broadcast and streaming. Last year, the IPL sold five-year broadcast rights for $6.5bn — a higher per-game price than many other pro sports, including England’s Premier League.\\nMeanwhile, Bollywood’s box office take had been trending down for many years before falling sharply during Covid, with yearly footfall down from 340mn to 190mn, and revenue of $190mn so far this year — down nearly half from the same period in 2019.\\nThe IPL understands and has adapted to the attention spans of the digital age. Its key innovation was shortening match times to under four hours, plus staging the full-on party that fans now expect: cheerleaders, DJs, dancing mascots and brightly coloured uniforms. Its streaming services allow viewers to pick a camera angle. Inspired by the IPL, Indian billionaires recently launched pro cricket in the US, aiming to draw American and Indian expat crowds to minor league stadiums where samosas will be on sale alongside hot dogs.\\nBollywood, by sticking to stale scripts and ageing stars, is losing Indian audiences even at home. The industry blames Covid for changing viewing habits. But Hollywood was affected by Covid, too, and its box office take is down by nearly one-fifth, not Bollywood’s half. Young Indians used to look forward eagerly to Friday for the next big Bollywood release — that era is gone.\\nTicket prices are rising for both Bollywood and cricket, but only the Hindi movie fans are increasingly staying at home. In 2021 and 2022, just 7 per cent of Bollywood films turned a profit, down from 30 per cent or more in the previous years. There are some quality productions but most of those are going out on streaming services, and many are made by newcomers and outsiders.\\nBollywood has rarely won best foreign film awards at major festivals and never at the Oscars, showing limited appeal on the global stage. More and more often, Hollywood’s output is upstaging Bollywood’s in India. On their recent opening weekends, Oppenheimer outpaced one of the bigger and better new domestic productions, Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani .\\nCricket speaks to the whole of India in a way Bollywood never has. Less than half of India’s population speaks its dominant language, Hindi, but Bollywood keeps rolling out films made for a Hindi-speaking audience. It is losing ground to increasingly vibrant regional film industries. India’s top grossing film last year was the Kannada language action-thriller K.G.F: Chapter 2 ; Bollywood scored none of the top five. Tamil and Telugu films attract more viewers than Hindi movies. Meanwhile, the IPL offers live match commentary in 12 languages on its streaming services.\\nBollywood dates to the 1930s, when its home city of Mumbai was still called Bombay, and its management style is as outdated as its name. Resting on family ties and a star system that allows its leading (often ageing) actors to command a solid majority take of the profits on each film, there is little left to fund better productions or new talent.\\nBy spreading the wealth the IPL is building momentum, sharing TV revenue and capping player salaries to make sure even small city teams can compete. It recruits talent from India’s least privileged corners. Rising star Yashasvi Jaiswal, 21, the son of a small shopkeeper in the poor state of Uttar Pradesh, lived for a time on the cricket grounds in his early training years.\\nThe IPL now ranks among the most stunning commercial success stories in global sports, with Bollywood among the most clueless flops in film industry history. Rather than admit they have issues, however, the movie impresarios wait for one of their increasingly rare hits then declare Bollywood is back. That happened earlier this year with Pathaan , a star vehicle for Shah Rukh Khan, aka “King Khan”. After 30 years in acting, he is one of those marquee names who can keep a majority of the profit on his films. Pathaan is a sign of decay not revival.\\nIt’s hard to imagine the Mumbai film industry reinventing itself in a modern form but the lesson for India is clear. What its economy needs is more cricket, less Bollywood.', metadata={'query': 'Potential for increased global viewership', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/bb671712-c8e8-45cd-86dc-a5d4e675004b', 'title': 'What India needs is more cricket and less Bollywood', 'publication_time': '2023-08-13T13:08:45.685Z'}, uuid=UUID('95e70edc-e985-49a0-94e0-77dd5f04979d'), db_id=''),\n",

The result was a 5.9mn bump in subscriber numbers in this year’s second quarter that was hailed as a show of strength by some analysts. But this is only a temporary fix.\\nLike ride-sharing company Uber, Netflix priced its streaming service at low rates to attract the biggest audience possible. Like Uber, it was then bombarded by rivals willing to spend large sums to compete. Six years ago, Netflix claimed that its only real competition was sleep. Now it includes comparisons to streaming competitors in its shareholder letter.\\nAs its shareholders grow weary of subsidising online services, prices are rising. NBCUniversal’s Peacock just lifted its cheapest monthly rate by $1 and Disney+’s US revenue per subscriber has picked up by 20 per cent in the past year.\\nThis means Netflix’s increases do not stand out. It is still the sector leader with nearly 239mn subscribers and expects another increase this quarter. But Netflix must spend more on marketing to draw in those subscribers.\\nLower costs are temporary too. In a repeat of the shutdowns that occurred during Covid-19 lockdowns, the Hollywood writers’ strike has stopped production of films and TV shows. That means Netflix will spend less on content. Free cash flow is expected to be at least $5bn this year, up from $1.6bn in 2022. Long-term debt has come down as well to $14.1bn from $14.9bn two years ago. One can sense that the focus is on level-headed financial decisions just by the near total lack of chatter about video games — an expensive endeavour that Netflix is also involved in.\\nBut when all of the users who were sharing passwords pay up or leave, Netflix will have to find new sources of revenue growth. Advertising subscriptions are not yet large enough for Netflix to choose to put a number on them. It is also a crowded field. Everyone, from YouTube to Uber, now tries to attract ad dollars.\\nIf Netflix wants to keep its focus on tweaking payments it could remove monthly subscriptions altogether and reduce churn by offering only annual or 18-month plans. Month-by-month payments were once a way to distinguish streaming from cable TV.

Britain’s leading commercial television company relies on cyclical advertising revenue for nearly half of its top line. Buying up production companies is meant to smooth out any volatility from viewer fickleness.\\nITV said on Friday that its next acquisition could be All3Media, owned by Warner Bros Discovery and John Malone’s Liberty Global. The latter in turn owns a tenth of ITV.\\nThis would shift the balance of ITV’s business towards Studios. Reportedly worth some £1bn, All3Media had around £750mn of revenues back in 2020 notes Citi. Even if these figures are sketchy, it would probably be ITV’s largest production company purchase so far. Studios, so far growing steadily over the years, would then lead on revenue contribution.\\nAll3Media has a considerable back library of locally popular shows including Midsomer Murders as well as multi-country, repeatable formats such as Gogglebox. All3Media’s 30,000 hours of library is sizeable, a third of ITV’s. All this should mean more recurrent revenue, which the market prefers, and less cyclicality to ITV’s earnings.\\nBut can ITV afford a chunky cash outlay? ITV should generate around £250-300mn of free cash flow, going forward. A healthy balance sheet — net debt roughly equals forward ebitda — leaves headroom to use debt financing. But much of free cash flow goes to dividends. And even if ITV could use the steadier income from All3Media, it is a little early to dismiss the broadcaster’s sensitivity to shifts in advertising spend. All else being equal, every 1 per cent drop in ad revenues currently takes 4 per cent from earnings per share, says Barclays.\\nThat explains a so-so reaction in the ITV share price to this prospect. That should give executives pause for thought.

The Scandi group tried to persuade viewers outside its core Nordic market of the worth of its added streaming choices.\\nViaplay uniquely offers original Scandinavian crime series. It also holds rights to stream sports, including Formula One and Premier League football in certain countries .\\nA rapid international expansion since 2020 was costly, adding operations in Poland, the UK, the US and Canada among other places. Losses at the international division rose to SKr1.4bn in 2022 from SKr505mn in 2021. This dwarfed the SKr1bn of operating profit from the core Nordic business last year.\\nThis picture is not expected to improve . Viaplay said on Monday that losses at its international business could widen this year to SKr1.5bn compared with a previously forecast loss of SKr1bn to SKr1.1bn.\\nViaplay had hoped its offering would prove “very resilient” to wider problems in the streaming market. Not so. Bigger rivals have reported consumers dropping one or more services .

Excluding production shutdowns during the coronavirus pandemic, the rate of expansion is the lowest in more than a decade where total worldwide spending jumped from $128bn to $243bn.\\nCommercial broadcasters such as RTL, Mediaset and ITV are facing some of the most severe pressure. Ampere predicts total original spending will fall by 3 per cent as the sector tries to cope with an advertising downturn, rising production costs and declining audiences for linear channels.\\nBut streaming services have also begun to enter more straitened times, as media groups rein in costs to manage slower than expected subscriber growth and ballooning losses from establishing the platforms.\\nTotal content spending for subscription streaming services, such as HBO Max, Disney Plus and Netflix , will continue to increase but at a rate of 8 per cent rather than the 25 per cent breakneck growth in 2022.\\n“Services will continue to focus on original content to compete in a crowded, cost-sensitive market, but we are already seeing a shift in content commissioning to incorporate a greater volume of cheaper unscripted formats,” said Hannah Walsh, research manager at Ampere.\\nRecommended\\nNetflix, which accounts for about 25 per cent of spending on original streaming shows, said it was holding spending steady at around $17bn a year, while trying to make its shows more “impactful”. “The key for me is not that you have to spend more and more money,” said Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s co-chief executive, last month. “It’s: can you get more impact per million dollar spend than anybody else?”\\nMeanwhile, big legacy media companies such as Disney , Paramount and Warner Bros Discovery are facing another year of heavy streaming losses, with Morgan Stanley estimating content costs per subscriber will be almost double that of Netflix while revenue per member will be lower.\\nExcluding Netflix, Morgan Stanley estimates streaming services suffered operating losses of around $10bn in 2022.

Alphabet reports only YouTube’s advertising revenue (which is down on last year).

Last year YouTube began showing NFL matches through a seven-year contract worth $14bn. And earlier this year Netflix announced it would be screening live WWE wrestling for $500mn a year from 2025.\\nUntil recently, streamers had often avoided live sports, largely due to the high costs of rights and technical challenges involved. But the technology has improved to the point where former sticking points, such as picture quality and time lag, are now acceptable to many fans. And while expensive, live sports are a powerful way of targeting multiple demographic segments and driving new subscriptions. Ad revenues are also becoming an increasingly important component of streamers' income. And few things can attract advertisers like live sporting events.\\nFor the sports leagues, streamers have a global reach that is particularly attractive. Netflix alone has more than 270mn subscribers worldwide. But traditional broadcasters are fighting back.\\nEarlier this year, Fox, Disney, and Warner Bros announced the launch of a new streaming platform, Venu Sports. Although the venture is tied up in the legal challenge, alleging it is anticompetitive. Those three companies own 55 per cent of US sports rights. Meanwhile, in the UK, Sky Sports launched a new streaming service this summer to run alongside its traditional broadcast platform.\\nAnother challenge for streamers is that their interest in sports rights has helped drive up prices. For example, between 2019 and 2024, the value of the US sports rights market grew by 54 per cent, compared to an overall TV industry revenue growth of just 15 per cent. While streamers' spending on sports rights has soared recently, that explosive growth may ease off in the coming years, not least because many of the major sports rights deals still have years to run before renewal. But despite that, we may have reached a tipping point in the way viewers consume live sports.\\n\\n\\nThe best-selling drones in the US are made by DJI in China - some Republican lawmakers plan to ban them\\nWhy Republican women back Donald Trump - despite sexist language, legal troubles, and abortion politics\\nWhy Sequoia and the venture capital industry are up against challenging times\\nThe Uber chief executive on company culture, competing with Amazon, and Elon Musk's robotaxis\\nNext year sees a new train service launch across Italy — La Dolce Vita Orient Express\\nThe mayor of London speaks to the FT about the link between child nutrition and learning, his views of Donald Trump and devolution\\nThe FT’s Myles McCormick looks at how a fluctuating power supply, combined with a low-regulation, business-friendly energy market have created ideal conditions to build battery storage sites\\nGenerative AI is set to reshape the workplace.

In Latin America, YouTube is live-streaming some sports in collaboration with Brazilian influencer Casimiro and Mexican broadcaster Claro Sports, offering viewers the option of watching four events simultaneously on one screen.\\nLast year YouTube began showing live NFL matches, through a seven-year contract worth $14bn to carry the league’s Sunday Ticket supplement across the US.

       "  (Document(text=\"\\nDaniel Thomas and Camilla Hodgson in London\\nAmazon’s Prime Video is undercutting rival Netflix on advertising pricing, as it battles for marketers’ attention in an increasingly crowded field of ad-funded streaming services.\\nAmazon introduced advertising to its Prime Video platform five months ago and is going through its first “up front” — when television companies present their plans to advertisers to attract money over the next year.\\nThe Seattle-based company has joined a highly competitive market for ad-supported streaming services . Most rival platforms — including Netflix, Max, Paramount+ and Disney+ — have brought in an ad-supported tier at a lower price than subscriptions that carry no ads.\\nAnalysts expect Apple to bring ads to its streaming TV+ service soon too. More conventional TV companies are also offering ad-supported streaming services, while Fox’s Tubi only offers shows backed by ads.\\nThe “bundles” that advertisers buy — in different formats and with various services attached — can make direct comparisons difficult. But multiple executives at rival services, as well as advertising bosses, said Amazon was pricing its spots more cheaply than Netflix, although at a higher rate than others such as Disney.\\nThe arrival of Amazon had already forced rivals to reduce their own pricing, according to advertising sources. One rival executive noted Amazon’s “vast supply of inventory”, adding: “There is downward pressure. They knew what they were doing in terms of flipping everybody over into the tier.”\\nAmazon and Netflix declined to comment.\\nAmazon’s arrival has particularly worried executives at rival streamers because of its existing strength in retail that analysts expect will fuel interest in its Prime ad slots.\\nThe ecommerce giant automatically converted all its more than 200mn total global subscribers to the ad tier — unless they actively chose to pay more for the premium ad-free service. That meant Amazon immediately had a huge audience with which to lure advertisers.\\nIt was a “pretty dramatic and contrarian move” and had resulted in a “sudden accumulation of an advertising audience, which is pretty powerful”, said Jonathan Carson, chief executive of industry data provider Antenna.\\nThe company has a vast trove of shopper data and the ability to direct viewers to its online stores.\\nOne US TV executive said competition had noticeably increased since Amazon’s entry, adding that Prime Video ads had “made a big impact”.\\nAmazon has rapidly grown its multibillion-dollar advertising business — driven by ads on its online stores — which generated $11.8bn in sales in the first quarter of 2024, up from $9.5bn in the year-ago period.\\nAnalysts at JPMorgan said in June that the division was Amazon’s “fastest-increasing revenue stream and one of its highest-margin businesses”.\\nThe arrival of Prime Video ads was likely to propel that growth, analysts expect. Citi estimated in January that Prime Video adverts could generate more than $5bn in “high-margin advertising revenue” as it builds up, albeit a figure still substantially below the $19bn Amazon invested in video and music content in 2023.\\nBaird analysts in May said they had seen “healthy demand from both traditional linear and streaming video advertisers” for the new Prime Video ad slots. This year was “the soft rollout of Prime streaming ads” with a “bigger step-up” expected in 2025, Baird said.\\nChief executive Andy Jassy has said he believes that Prime Video can be “a large and profitable business on its own”.\\nAdvertising executives said Amazon offered brands the chance to target specific audiences thanks to the data it has from its retail platform.\\nPrime Video adverts were “the perfect closed loop attribution that we’ve been waiting for on linear TV” because “Amazon knows who you are” and what a viewer has bought on the Amazon.com website, said Citi analyst Ron Josey. “It’s a very large opportunity for them.”\\nIn May, Amazon announced “shoppable” ad formats for Prime Video to allow viewers to add products to their Amazon shopping cart during ad breaks using their smart TV remotes.\\nOne ad executive said that every brand was interested in “higher efficiency and more targeting” — both of which were being offered by Amazon.\\nHasbro adopted Prime Video advertising for a six-week test run in the UK, using Amazon first-party data to target parents. It found that two-thirds of Peppa Pig purchases during that period were new to the brand, adding that sales for those toy products on Amazon had increased 18 per cent, year on year.\\n“There is a sales pitch which has a buy one buy all, but when you get into it it's not quite there yet,” said another ad exec, pointing to the range of retail and video options as well as Twitch, the gaming platform. “But they will get there.”\\nAccording to Antenna’s Carson, the number of Prime subscribers who paid to opt out of ads was pretty substantial at first but quickly “trailed off”. At the end of May, less than a tenth had paid more for no advertising, they found.\\nOther streamers are also having success on their ad-supported tiers as cost-conscious consumers look at how many subscriptions they can maintain. Netflix has said that it has 40mn monthly active users globally on its ad tier, attracting between 40-50 per cent of new sign-ups.\\nAd plans had gone from 28 per cent to 38 per cent of the premium streaming market in the past two years, and made up more than half of gross additions for the first time in the last quarter of 2023, and first of 2024, according to Antenna.\\nThe focus on bolstering Prime Video’s financials marked a change from how Amazon had originally conceived of the streaming service, former company insiders said, seen at one time as a way to get consumers to sign up for the Prime subscription service.\\nAmazon’s Prime Video and Studios divisions were among those hit by lay-offs this year as the company sought to cut costs across the board and after big spending on blockbuster shows such as the Lord of the Rings series.\\nBut analysts and ad executives say there is more than enough content on Prime — new and old — to ensure that Amazon can take a dominant position in the market for advertising for streamers.\\n“It’s their playbook. Amazon has always been like a company that builds massive market share, then they monetise it,” said one ad executive. “You see they did that with ecommerce. They did that with cloud computing, and they’re now doing it with their ads business.”\", metadata={'query': 'Potential for increased global viewership', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/d45c4153-6c11-4f1e-9009-62f8adf5ac2b', 'title': 'Amazon Prime Video undercuts rival Netflix on advertising prices', 'publication_time': '2024-07-30T04:00:28.402Z'}, uuid=UUID('574f1d1c-2d6b-467e-aadb-a5448be47162'), db_id=''),\n",

This puts it 4 per cent ahead of regional rival Starz Play Arabia and 5 per cent ahead of Netflix, according to industry analyst Omdia.\\nMBC has poured money into streaming in the past four years, pinning its hopes for growth on Shahid, which is not yet profitable, to cater for increasing viewer numbers, particularly in the oil-rich Gulf states. Shahid reported SR900mn ($240mn) in losses between 2020 and the first half of 2023.\\nTelevision is “not where we’re going to get the growth from”, MBC’s chief executive Sam Barnett told the Financial Times. “We’re getting similar [TV] viewership we had in previous years. We’re maintaining market share. It’s the media that is changing\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009we are seeing the shift of people to using [streaming].”\\nShahid says it now has 4.8mn paying subscribers in the region, while 20mn regularly watch its advertising-supported streaming service, which attracts viewers with long-running dramas such as Love Game , an Arabic version of a Turkish series about a woman’s attempts to marry a rich shoe designer to help her indebted brother.\\nBarnett said MBC had defied critics who said “the global streamers are coming to eat your lunch. You are this parochial Middle Eastern company. There’s no way you can stand up to\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009Netflix and Disney+ and HBO Max.”\\nThe shift from television to streaming has challenged broadcasters worldwide, but in a region lacking reliable TV audience data, it also presents an opportunity. Viewers in the Middle East’s more than 20 countries are polled only occasionally, often through surveys commissioned by media companies themselves. But streaming services allow media companies to see what customers are watching and how much advertising they are exposed to.\\nMBC’s streaming bet is also helped by demographics: more than 55 per cent of the Middle East and north Africa’s population are under 30, compared with 36 per cent across OECD countries. They are both digital savvy and keen for content, while expecting the same high production values they see on the likes of Netflix. To meet these expectations, Shahid is funding local talent as well as recruiting foreign producers and directors to make content.\\nBarnett described management’s approach to making new programmes as “constructively paranoid about everything”, adding that to try to keep spending at reasonable levels “I have all the creatives in the room, and then I sit them down with the accountants. And we have difficult meetings.”\\nThat approach appears to be working. Shahid lost SR6mn in the first three months of this year, but the figure is improving as subscription and advertising revenues rise. Losses for the same period last year were SR102mn. At the same time, revenues rose 72 per cent year on year to SR298mn, boosted by Ramadan falling in the first quarter. Families traditionally tune in to month-long TV series during that time, making it a top period for advertising spending.\\nKarim Sarkis, a media and entertainment specialist at consultancy Strategy&, said Shahid’s free streaming service and Arabic-language shows and films are helping it compete with Netflix.\\nThose anticipating that Netflix would commission large amounts of Arabic language content have been disappointed, Sarkis said, while “MBC have also woken up in the meantime\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009if they continue competing in the same way\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009I think the [long term] winner is going to be Shahid”.\\nFounded in London in 1991 as the Arab world’s first private satellite channel, the Middle East Broadcasting Corporation was an unusual commercial player in a regional media industry dominated by state-owned networks — that are crucial for projecting soft power — and billionaires’ vanity projects.\\nIts recent history has had TV-worthy moments of drama. In November 2017, founder and chair Waleed bin Ibrahim Al Ibrahim was caught up in an anti-corruption campaign orchestrated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, where hundreds of members of Saudi Arabia’s elites were detained in the Ritz-Carlton hotel and forced to transfer cash and assets to the government.\\nFollowing the incident, Ibrahim’s ownership fell from 100 to 40 per cent of the company while an investment company owned by the finance ministry took the other 60 per cent. It sold a part of that stake in an initial public offering last year and since the listing, MBC’s share price is up about 30 per cent to SR44.\\nThe government still owns more than half of MBC’s shares but Ibrahim retained the chairmanship and is actively involved in the business. Barnett said: “Like many big media moguls, he has strong opinions on content.”\\nGauging which shows will work is critical, Barnett said. Many countries in the region have strict content rules and some streamers have been rebuked by regional regulators for showing scenes such as same-sex kissing. In 2019, Netflix was forced to remove an episode of a comedy show after a complaint by Saudi Arabia, adding to concerns about political interference.\\nMBC and Shahid try “to approach the line, but not fall over it so you are alienating your audiences”, Barnett said, citing this year’s Kuwaiti drama Zawja Waheda La Takfi ( One Wife Is Not Enough ), which tackled the subject of polygamy.\\nBut some of Shahid’s original content has caused controversy. A mini-series on the 1988 hijacking of a Kuwaiti aircraft was pulled in response to protests from the country’s information ministry. The streamer also delayed showing a major television series in early 2021, based on the true story of a Saudi drug trafficker, after his tribe said it was insulting.\\nBeyond content, Shahid has tried to cater to the large and often multigenerational families in the region by allowing up to 20 devices to connect to each subscription.\\n“We are trying to establish what’s the right balance, because like all streamers, we also see abuse of password sharing,” said Natasha Matos-Hemingway, chief commercial, marketing and product officer of Shahid. However, “we’d be hurt very badly if we were to reduce [device allowances] to like two or three”.', metadata={'query': 'Potential for increased global viewership', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/c20b3bbc-b3a7-46c0-91ea-88e60501d922', 'title': 'How Saudi Arabia’s MBC came to dominate Middle East streaming', 'publication_time': '2024-07-07T04:00:28.440Z'}, uuid=UUID('29febb17-aac5-44d6-8d25-96267b5e348b'), db_id=''),\n",

Most homes use both options, though the balance is shifting online.\\nThose households more likely to rely only on terrestrial TV included people who were older, less affluent, or had a disability, Ofcom said.\\nBroadcast 2040+, a campaign group to safeguard terrestrial TV and radio after 2040, said: “Without certainty about its future, millions who use and rely on broadcast services, including many of the most vulnerable in society and those who cannot or do not wish to pay for superfast broadband or who lack digital skills, face the threat of TV exclusion.”\\nMore people are shunning TV altogether for social media or other internet services, however.\\nRecommended\\nOfcom said the average person in the UK spent a quarter less time watching daily broadcast TV in 2023 than in 2018, at 149 minutes. Viewing of scheduled TV channels through terrestrial TV is forecast by the watchdog to drop from 62 per cent of viewing of total long form programmes in 2023 to 28 per cent by 2035, and 22 per cent by 2040.\\nEd Leighton, Ofcom’s director of strategy and policy, said terrestrial television “faces big long-term challenges and audiences who rely on it deserve a solution that is sustainable and fit for the future”.\\nIn response to the Ofcom consultation, the BBC said it expected a “tipping point in the coming years where the cost per head\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009is no longer viable for one or many of the broadcasters that currently collectively make them viable”.\\nThe corporation said broadcast viewing was already in decline among all audience groups, and particularly among younger audiences. “Embracing and improving [internet TV] is the only way to meet all audience needs and expectations for quality and choice — and to future-proof universality,” the national broadcaster added.\\nUS media group Paramount, which owns Channel 5, warned that there “may come a point in which distribution by [terrestrial TV] for commercial broadcasters is simply not viable”.\\nIt said in response to the consultation that the cost per viewer had to represent “reasonable economic value to a commercial public service broadcaster” and this “should not compromise Channel 5’s ability to invest”.', metadata={'query': 'Potential for increased global viewership', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/0bb4f0a2-c31d-4479-b268-b84dc88fc341', 'title': 'Terrestrial TV in UK threatened by online shift, say broadcasters', 'publication_time': '2024-05-09T15:05:28.018Z'}, uuid=UUID('5c1ab71e-b4c4-4306-97c3-1e8b7c1c3af5'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nCristina Criddle\\nInfluencer marketing agencies in Europe are booming as brands shift their advertising spend from traditional media to social networks. And the financial impact is already apparent in their revenues, as the ‘creator economy’ responds to the way consumers use online platforms — such as Instagram , YouTube and TikTok — to inform their shopping choices.\\nThe whole content creator sector is now expected to roughly double in size by 2027, to be worth nearly half a trillion dollars, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs.\\n“The market has evolved, we are way more professional as an industry, and the return on investment when influencer marketing is done right is incredible,” says Thomas Angerer, co-founder of BeInfluence, a Belgium-based agency, which is ranked 58th in the latest FT 1000 list of Europe’s fastest-growing companies . It is one of nine companies specialising in influencer marketing to make the list.\\nBeInfluence, which was founded in 2017, has grown its revenues over the past year to €4mn, Angerer says, and is forecast to generate up to €7.5mn in 2024. He says newcomers to social media have aided growth, such as the European Commission and French government, which are now clients.\\nThis success reflects a huge change in media consumption. The proportion of people watching traditional broadcast television in the UK each week shrank faster than ever last year , according to media regulator Ofcom, as audiences turned to digital services, such as social media and streaming, for entertainment.\\nMarket research firm Mintel found that 69 per cent of 16- to 24-year-olds who follow social media personalities spent more time watching their content online than watching TV.\\nAdvertisers will go where there are eyeballs\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009. but they will also go where they can justify that spend\\n“People have decision fatigue, and short video algorithms reward not having to make a decision about what to watch, [unlike] TV,” says Rebecca McGrath, associate director for media and technology at Mintel.\\n“We are seeing growth partly because of the changes in the platform formats, with short videos becoming such a big aspect across the [social media] networks. That means consumers have a more passive experience on social media, rather than being active posters, which helps facilitate the popularity of influencer content,” she explains.\\nHer research found that 28 per cent of 16- to 24-year-olds who follow social media personalities have had their financial choices affected by at least one of these individuals.\\nFor brands, a further benefit of social media content over traditional advertising is being able to gather data on its effectiveness, because digital platforms can show levels of user engagement on posts.\\n“Advertisers will go where there are eyeballs, advertisers will go where there are emerging generations of spend, but they will also go where they can justify that spend,” explains Becky Owen, global chief marketing and innovation officer at Billion Dollar Boy, another agency in the FT 1000 ranking. “Big money wants to go where big money can be accountable, and traditional means are often quite difficult to assess,” she says, noting that brands “are getting more data on performance in social spaces than they are in other spaces”.\\nBDB says its client roster grew by 35 per cent last year and, in recent months, brands including Spotify, Diageo, Disney+, Amazon and Dove have committed to spending £11mn with the agency. The company, which also appeared in the FT 1000 ranking last year, is now investing in innovation and growth projects, such as the use of artificial intelligence.\\nAnother area BDB and many others are beginning to expand into is assisting entrepreneurial creators in launching their own products.\\n“It is a very important part of a career for an influencer, now, to have revenue streams other than advertising, because different platforms have different metrics, short-form video is harder to monetise, and creators are very reliant on algorithms,” says McGrath. “Having direct payments or product ranges is important for a long-term career.”\\nFor the most successful influencers, these revenue streams are more valuable than advertising. US influencer Jimmy Donaldson, known online as MrBeast, with a record 240mn subscribers on YouTube, now sells a range of food products off the back of his social media success.\\nRecommended\\nThe 25-year-old says he “loses money” on brand deals as advertisers cannot pay enough for viewership. “There’s only so much money brands are willing to spend on a video\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009for me to get paid a fair price on [a video with 300mn views]\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009it is literally half their entire yearly spend,” he told The Unfiltered Conversation podcast in June last year.\\n“It is harder and harder to find brand deals for us that keep up with the pace\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009so, it makes more and more sense for me to just build companies that I own because I know if I promote something, that it converts and actually leads to real sales. And so ideally, one day, I don’t have to do brand deals anymore.”\\nHowever, one potential challenge for the industry is regulation, as media rules are adapted to include influencers. In recent years, the EU and the UK have introduced specific regulations to crack down on influencer marketing, in the Digital Services Act and the Online Safety Act, respectively. They have focused in particular on social media ac\\xadcounts that do not disclose when they have been paid to promote products.\\nBut it is a gradual process. “Until we have a European regulation framework, we have 27 different laws [due to the different member states]\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009. and, for a European agency like ourselves, it is very complicated to navigate all the different regulations,” says Angerer.', metadata={'query': 'Potential for increased global viewership', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/7dbc592a-1027-4e89-80ce-f12ca479a2c1', 'title': 'Upstart agencies tap into influencers', 'publication_time': '2024-03-25T05:00:28.010Z'}, uuid=UUID('5f73030c-6182-49fe-a4b6-e2bbe3f6ee90'), db_id=''),\n",

On Tuesday, three titans — Disney, Warner Brothers Discovery and Fox — announced yet another streaming service . The trio will provide their live sports content via one streaming platform.\\nSports-as-a-package is already widely available. It is the backbone of traditional linear pay TV. The new joint venture gets at the heart of the dilemma of modern TV viewership.\\nStreaming is no doubt the future. But a fragmented marketplace renders any single streaming service unprofitable. Stapling disparate services together heralds the ultimate package: M&A consolidation.\\nThe new deal could speed up the move away from traditional cable TV while copying cable TV’s bundling model.\\nTo see why this is required look at Disney’s sports network ESPN, one of the biggest puzzles in media. It generates about $16bn of annual revenue and $3bn to $4bn of ebitda. But those formidable numbers are slowly melting away. A decade ago there were 100mn pay TV households. That figure has dropped to 70mn. ESPN charges distributors $8 or $9 per month per subscriber, whether they want the sports channel or not.\\nIn a world of streaming, consumers can more easily opt out of paying for programming they don’t want.\\xa0Disney has debuted a standalone ESPN streaming service but it knows there may not be an audience big enough to support spending billions of dollars on sports rights. The valuation multiple now ascribed to ESPN may be too low for Disney’s business, which includes theme parks and the movie studio. But ESPN’s annual cash flow is too valuable to give up in a sale or spin-off.\\nEarlier this week, the commissioner of the National Football League said that a streaming-only Super Bowl would not happen soon. The prediction reveals how vital legacy television remains for content producers.\\nYet the broadcaster showing this year’s game, Paramount, is traditional television’s most distressed provider. A relative minnow, it has an enterprise value of just $25bn. By evaluating takeover bids, it recognises that even offering one of the world’s most watched sporting events does not ensure it can survive independently.\\nBundling digital services could help to solve that problem. Offering packages of TV services is not a novel concept. Hulu and YouTube have live TV options while Amazon Prime offers access to multiple channels.

       "  (Document(text='\\nDisney’s decision to license more TV shows to Netflix this year marks a turning point in the expensive battle for supremacy in online streaming. Under pressure to stem losses, entertainment companies are opting to sell more of their content to Netflix. By waiting out its rivals, Netflix has eclipsed them.\\nIt has done this through a vast, debt-fuelled expansion followed by concerted cost cutting. When entertainment companies first competed in streaming they began by hoarding their most popular TV shows and films. The loss of shows like Friends put pressure on Netflix to build up its own back catalogue. It expanded into reality TV, romcoms and international series while handing over large sums of money to well-known showrunners such as Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy. By 2021, annual content spend in cash terms exceeded $17bn.\\nThe price Netflix paid for all that content was falling margins and a heavy debt load that exceeds $14bn. While the pandemic added millions of new subscribers, competition and subscription fatigue led to a subsequent dip in 2022. Netflix’s operating margin dropped sharply from 21 per cent to 18 per cent. The company’s market cap traded below Disney’s.\\nBy focusing on operating margins, Netflix has staged a comeback . It has cracked down on password sharing, promoted an advertising-supported subscription tier and raised prices.\\nBut the real change has come from cost cutting, aided by a writers’ strike in Hollywood that halted productions. While revenue rose 6.6 per cent in 2023, net income rose 20 per cent. Not only has the operating margin recovered but chief financial officer Spencer Neumann is predicting a margin of up to 24 per cent this year — a new high for the company.\\nCompare Netflix with Disney and Netflix comes out ahead, as its market cap now indicates. Disney’s direct-to-consumer unit, which includes streaming service Disney+, is still reporting large operating losses. Activist investor Nelson Peltz says Disney’s streaming service should target “ Netflix-like margins ” of 15 to 20 per cent. This might be achieved by cutting back on content spend and licensing more content — two moves that would further serve Netflix.\\xa0Dearth of new content elsewhere may explain why Netflix is still adding new subscribers.\\nFor Netflix, this may still be a partial victory. Streaming remains an expensive business with low revenue per subscriber. YouTube is more popular than any streaming service and much of its content is created for free by users. Its revenue is mainly advertising, with subscriptions a bonus. The business is part of Google’s Services business, which boasts an operating margin of 35 per cent.\\nCompare Netflix with YouTube instead of Disney and the model looks altogether less appealing.\\nLex is the FT’s concise daily investment column.

Physical formats, such as CDs and vinyl albums, will recede to 13 per cent of revenue in 2027, from nearly 17 per cent in 2022, Omdia says.\\nEven as streaming services have expanded to many countries around the globe, Omdia expects North America to remain the bedrock of music spending by a wide margin.\\nThe region will account for 43.2 per cent of global recorded music buying in 2027, down only slightly from 43.9 per cent in 2022, Omdia analysts forecast. Europe will maintain its number two spot, with 27 per cent of global music spending, the consultancy adds.\\nSpotify launched a decade and a half ago, and hundreds of millions of people across the world now pay a monthly fee to stream music. The streaming pioneer reached 226mn paying subscribers at the end of September.\\nBut the early land-grab of new subscribers is slowing in some regions, leaving the music industry to find ways to keep up momentum and fuel future growth. “The days of high double-digit growth are long gone”, Omdia warns. “Developed countries all face the problem of what to do when the subscriber pool dries up”.\\nCountries to watch 2023-2027\\nUS Developments in the world’s biggest recorded-music market will flow through to the rest of the world\\nChina Leading services are adding users in increasingly significant numbers\\nBrazil Once a global top five market, recent subscription gains could signal the country’s return to the industry’s top ranks\\nIndia Despite persistently low per-capita sales, the population size means the country cannot be ignored\\nSource: FT-Omdia Digital Economies Index\\nIn the US, this slowdown has already begun. Last year, US recorded music revenue rose 6 per cent compared with the prior year, to $15.9bn, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, the trade group. This was its slowest growth rate since 2016, when the business had just begun to bounce back from its piracy-driven downturn.\\nIn the next phase of music streaming’s evolution, Omdia analysts suggest that streaming companies will need to strike a balance with pricing.\\nInvestment bank TD Cowen notes that the amount consumers spend on music relative to their other expenses is less than half of the level it reached during the 1990s. “Not only is music still relatively inexpensive; the product has also improved significantly, with streaming services offering access to a library of virtually all music ever created on easily portable devices”, says analyst Doug Creutz. Against this backdrop, he expects further price rises in the coming years.\\nGoldman Sachs analysts believe that the monetisation of music has “significantly lagged consumption” and also expect price rises “on a regular basis, especially in an environment of higher inflation”.\\nWhen Spotify launched in 2008, “the environment for recorded music sales was completely different”, says Simon Dyson, Omdia analyst. “Piracy was still horrendous. There was still lots of free music floating around. The $9.99 [price] was in line with the price of a CD.”\\nIt would take more than a decade for Spotify to raise the price of its standard subscription in the US, the world’s largest recorded music market. The streaming group announced a $1 rise in July of this year, with Americans now paying $11 a month to stream all the world’s music. Spotify said the price rise would help the company “keep innovating in changing market conditions”. Rival Apple Music last year raised the price of its music subscription to $11 a month.\\nDyson anticipates that Spotify will continue raising prices by $1 every year going forward. “It’s very underpriced for what it’s offering,” he says. “Even if they do a price rise next year and the year after, I think it will still be underpriced.”\\nEarly financial results suggest Spotify has pricing power. During the quarter when Spotify raised prices, the group still managed to sign up 6mn new subscribers, above the 4mn it had forecast. The group also turned a profit for the first time in more than a year. Chief executive and co-founder Daniel Ek said the results proved that Spotify could become a “great business”.\\n“Because of our confidence in our product and our ever-expanding content offering, we felt the timing was right to raise prices”, Ek, the 40-year-old billionaire, told investors on an earnings call.\\nOmdia analysts believe that music companies and streaming services “need to be more proactive” in offering different pricing and subscription options. At the moment, Spotify, Apple, Amazon, YouTube and others all offer a similar catalogue of songs at similar prices. Omdia expects these services will need to differentiate themselves in the same way that Netflix and video platforms do, with exclusive content.\\nSpotify has made strides towards this, making a push into podcasts and audiobooks with the goal of expanding its scope to all things audio — not just music. Spotify is even offering UK and Australia subscribers 15 hours of audiobook listening per month at no extra cost, an offer that it plans to expand to the US in the coming months.\\nHowever, Omdia analysts expect streaming companies will eventually need to split some of these offerings into different subscription tiers or add-ons. “It may seem like a good idea to increase the breadth of content to limit churn, but continuing to keep all audio content in a single silo really is a recipe for disaster,” they warn.', metadata={'query': 'Potential for increased global viewership', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1e3c5cca-75ba-4846-8ccd-d20dc6534e06', 'title': 'North America set to keep its grip on music streaming', 'publication_time': '2023-11-06T05:30:57.575Z'}, uuid=UUID('e2c20357-94af-4349-87ef-e55923f0fccb'), db_id=''),\n",

The country is also predicted to see the world’s fastest growth in revenue for online advertising over the period, at a compound annual rate of 12.7 per cent.\\nThis predicted increase in digital advertising comes as India’s 1.4bn strong population, more than half of which is under 30 years old , spends ever more time online.\\nMukesh Kumar, associate partner at Redseer Strategy Consultants, estimates that India’s overall advertising market is worth $15bn-$16bn, with digital accounting for a little more than $9bn of that.\\n“Overall, at an India level, digital is clearly the number one media,” says Abhishek Mukherjee, chief business officer at Bengaluru-based media buying agency The Media Ant. “Today, it has overtaken television and it’s probably going to become upward of 55, 60 per cent [of advertising spend] in the years to come.”\\nSuch rapid adoption of digital channels is a boon for US tech companies YouTube and Meta, which can expect to see their video advertising revenues in India grow in the mid to high-teen percentages until 2025, according to Omdia forecasts. Last year, traditional market leader YouTube’s video advertising revenues in India were Rs57.5bn (roughly $690mn), representing 20 per cent year-on-year growth — and even that was its slowest growth for several years, Omdia data shows.\\n“Video is the fastest growing digital ad market in India,” notes Redseer’s Kumar. “This video advertising segment is growing around 30-35 per cent compound annual growth rate for the next three to four years”.\\nAnd it is not only the US video giant that is increasing revenues. “Excluding YouTube, the total market for video streaming would be approximately $1.5bn in India,” says Kumar. Of that, “around 40 per cent would be ad revenue, $600mn-$650mn”.\\nThe diversion of advertising revenue from traditional media to online streaming is illustrated by Network18, the broadcaster and media group part owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries.\\nOmdia forecasts that net advertising revenues at Network 18’s traditional TV assets will grow by roughly 10 per cent next year, before slowing to 8.6 per cent growth in 2025. By contrast, Network 18’s online assets, Omdia predicts, will see advertising revenue growth of 40 per cent next year, and 20 per cent the year after.\\nSome media companies are so convinced by the profit potential of online advertising that they are giving away their most valuable assets to viewers.\\nViacom18, which is part owned by Network18, last year spent Rs237bn (close to $3bn) on rights to stream the world’s biggest domestic cricket tournament, the Indian Premier League, on its streaming app JioCinema. But, rather than using the sporting phenomenon to attract paying subscribers, it made the matches free to view — aiming to recoup the heavy cost by selling more advertising space.\\nSimilarly, the popular India streaming service, MX Player, which offers movies and web series on demand, has a subscription option but can largely be watched for free by viewers — if they don’t mind the advertising.\\nIt is a business model that makes economic sense in this market. For many Indian consumers, subscription streaming services are still unaffordable, even if they are much cheaper than elsewhere.

Organisations are now more willing than ever to allow employees to use personal devices for work. Simultaneously, I’ve found that employees prefer the flexibility that comes with using their own device over a work one, to check emails or send work-related messages.\\nHowever, while the convenience of BYOD is clear, it can be seen as the “Wild West” of information security — and for good reason. Ivanti discovered that BYOD was practised at 84 per cent of organisations globally, though just 52 per cent allow it. Among those that do not allow it, 78 per cent of IT and security professionals say employees use BYOD even when forbidden. Whether permitted or not, the use of personal devices will always happen. And for this reason, organisations must prepare, or risk creating an environment where their security inevitably suffers.\\nUnfortunately, many organisations are still struggling to establish the right security infrastructure to handle this — just 63 per cent are able to track BYOD alongside corporate-owned IT assets. This can leave businesses vulnerable to data breaches, leaks or ransomware. Verizon’s 2024 Mobile Security Index report shows the percentage of companies that suffered a mobile compromise has steadily increased, from less than 30 per cent in 2018 to more than half (53 per cent).\\nFailing to effectively track BYOD exposes businesses to cyber risks. Even if they set rules against it, employees will find a way around them. Today, implementing a BYOD security procedure is a no-brainer. It’s what will provide businesses with the visibility and control to effectively secure, manage and monitor every mobile device on its network.\\nDavid Shepherd SVP EMEA, Ivanti, Wokingham, UK', metadata={'query': 'Legal considerations surrounding password sharing', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/06465a8f-5348-419e-b2e2-37c1737bc47a', 'title': 'Letter: Technology and culture shifts collide in workplace', 'publication_time': '2024-12-02T05:01:34.625Z'}, uuid=UUID('9f8f63c3-6698-4346-816a-e0d821b08e1c'), db_id=''),\n",

While visitors to parliament have to be accompanied at all times, passholders are cleared to roam the estate where MPs, journalists and staffers work.\\nUnder the current rules, MPs may give a security pass to individuals provided they are using it to “directly support” the MPs’ parliamentary work, which has to be declared on the register of staff interests. The MPs must also list where passholders have other jobs that may be “clearly advantaged” by having a pass, such as working for a lobbying organisation.\\nWhen a staff member leaves, MPs must inform parliamentary authorities, who are responsible for cancelling the passes and email addresses.\\nIn total, there were at least 33 people listed in the most recent register as passholders sponsored by MPs who were also working as lobbyists for public affairs companies, unions or other organisations at the same time as they had passes.\\nBut the FT found that at least three people did not have their roles disclosed by the relevant MP in the past year.\\nNandy sponsored a pass for an employee in May 2022, when she was still in opposition.

Their position with the communications firm was not disclosed on the register.\\nWhen contacted by the FT, Spencer said he employed the individual on a part-time basis that was “unrelated to any other employment that [they] had”.\\nHe said the person had since left his office to take up another role.\\nHe added: “We did not sponsor their pass so that they could work on other projects or indeed use their pass for other purposes. To the best of our knowledge no external advocacy has taken place.”\\nMontfort Communications said: “It is a clear and unacceptable breach of our company policy. The individual has been suspended immediately pending an investigation into conduct.”\\nCurtis sponsored an individual who was also employed at communications consultancy Pagefield, though their position at the public affairs group was not disclosed on the register.\\nWhen approached, the Labour MP said the person was employed on a part-time basis while joining from the communications agency, and now worked exclusively for his office. Curtis said that “the register of interests has now been amended”.\\nPagefield said it was “unfortunate that there was an administrative oversight” but that it had been “reassured that this has now been rectified”.\\nThe most recent register also lists Jones as sponsoring lobbyists from Arup and Baringa for parliamentary passes.

Both pleaded not guilty on Friday.\\nParliament has different bodies responsible for various parts of its operations.

       "  (Document(text='\\nLucy Warwick-Ching\\nI’m getting married later this year and my business partner has suggested I should get a pre-nup between myself and my husband. As I’m a co-owner of a successful fintech company my business partner is worried that I might have to sell my shares if I get divorced. We plan to sell our business in three years and they don’t want that disrupted. Is this something that I can cover in a prenuptial agreement?\\nCaroline Keeley, partner and head of family law at TWM Solicitors , says the request from your business partner shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise as wedding season is now preceded by pre-nup season.\\xa0Nor is it uncommon for business partners to require each other to enter into a nuptial agreement.\\nThese agreements (pre or post-marriage) are there to manage how a couple will deal with their financial arrangements in case the relationship breaks down. A well drawn-up agreement should be able to protect your business interests.\\nIn deciding how to protect your assets, you also need to consider what powers the court has in relation to sharing your business assets in a divorce. The family court has the ultimate power to share all matrimonial assets, which can include shareholdings in a private limited business, regardless of what either party contributed to the purchase or growth of the business. This means the court could require you to sell or transfer your shares to your spouse.\\nRecommended\\nWhile the court can decide to transfer shares from one spouse to another, this isn’t ideal because the court usually prefers to separately divide assets post-separation. It may, however, be necessary if the company’s managers expect it to be sold in the future.\\nThe court can also order the sale of shares in a private company if it’s the only way to meet the financial needs of both parties. Ideally, the shareholder might want to pay a lump sum to the other party to settle any claims against the business, but figuring out the value can be complicated and expensive. Additionally, the money needs to be available to make the payment.\\nIn the pre-nup it could be helpful to note that the shares were acquired before the marriage or even if they were inherited. You also need to decide if you’re protecting just the capital value of the shares or also the income generated from the business as well. The first step is to clearly define the shares in the agreement.\\nThen there’s another question to consider: do you want to keep the shares separate so that the money from a future sale stays separate from the marital assets; or do you agree that your partner can benefit from them but want to stop them from forcing an early sale?\\nThe financial needs of the parties will always take priority over any protection of the business. Therefore, if you want to include provisions that stop one party from forcing a sale or transfer of the shares then it is important to ensure that there are other provisions in place so that the financially dependent party is able to meet their needs, particularly their housing needs, in other ways. This is vitally important if the couple has children or plans on having children.\\nI am approaching my two-year anniversary at my job, and I have heard noises that the firm might cut some jobs, with those who joined less than two years ago most vulnerable. With the fixed term of my mortgage approaching, I would be in a poor financial position if am let go. Do I have any legal rights if I am made redundant?\\nChris Deeley, employment associate at law firm JMW Solicitors in London, says as the law currently stands, you would not gain full protection against unfair dismissal as an employee until you reach two years’ service. Unfortunately, this means it is considerably more straightforward for your employer to make you redundant. This would save your employer from significant costs, as conducting a fair and thorough redundancy process can be very time-consuming. If you have less than two years’ service you will still be entitled to notice pay and any other contractual entitlements up to your termination date, but you will not be entitled to any statutory redundancy pay.\\nThe lack of unfair dismissal protection means that currently you could be dismissed for almost any reason and even without following a fair process, although there are a few exceptions. The most common are dismissals for discriminatory reasons, or those done to punish an employee for whistleblowing or for alleging that the employer has infringed their statutory rights. For example, your employer should not use attendance records as a factor to determine redundancy, because this could disadvantage those who have needed to take more sick leave than others because of a disability, and so could constitute disability discrimination.\\nRecommended\\nIf you are made redundant before your two-year anniversary and decide to take legal action, the burden before an employment tribunal would be on you to show that the true reason for your dismissal was a prohibited one, which can be a very difficult task. Your employer can simply point to your lack of rights meaning you will be cheaper and easier to dismiss. In most cases, barring where explicit evidence to the contrary exists, that will probably be enough reason to justify a lawful dismissal.\\nIf you reach two years’ service, however, the story will be different — you will gain unfair dismissal rights, meaning your employer would need to follow a full and fair redundancy process to lawfully dismiss you for redundancy.\\nMy husband and I currently own an investment property in the Midlands and have been looking to invest in additional properties with an eye to running a furnished holiday let business in our area, which I would run myself in a full-time capacity. We recently came into an inheritance which means we are now in a position to buy. However, I understand there are a number of tax changes due in 2025 that may impact both the furnished holiday-let and buy-to-let market. How should I build my property portfolio from a tax perspective — am I better off as a landlord or an Airbnb host?\\nThis protection can kick in slightly early — if you are dismissed with immediate effect within one week before you reach the two-year mark, you can still benefit from unfair dismissal protection, as had you been given the one week’s notice required by statute, you would have crossed the two-year mark and gained those same rights.\\nThe new Labour government has pledged to reduce the qualifying period for unfair dismissal protection, possibly making this a “day-one” right, and this was included in the King’s Speech. Legislation to make this proposal into law is yet to be tabled, but if it comes into force, it is likely to require employers to reconsider how they deal with redundancy situations, as well as other dismissals.\\nThe opinions in this column are intended for general information purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional advice.

       "  (Document(text='\\nHannah Murphy in San Francisco\\nTikTok and its Chinese parent ByteDance said on Tuesday that they had filed a lawsuit against the US government challenging a law that would force a sale or ban of the app.\\nLast month, Washington passed legislation requiring TikTok to divest from its parent by January 19 2025 or face a countrywide ban, citing concerns that the Chinese Communist party could wield data on the app’s 170mn US users for espionage purposes, or proliferate propaganda via the platform.\\nIn a petition, filed with the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and posted on its website, TikTok claimed that the law was unconstitutional, breaching First Amendment free speech rights. It also argued that Congress had “enacted these extreme measures without a single legislative finding”, and that the act would constitute “unlawful taking of private property”.\\nThe law, signed by President Joe Biden, has aggravated US-China tensions , and the lawsuit is the first step in a legal battle that is likely to decide TikTok’s fate in the US and could make its way to the Supreme Court.\\nIn the filing, TikTok said a sale would be “simply not possible” as a standalone US app was not commercially or technologically viable, particularly within the 270-day timeline stipulated by the law. It also noted that Beijing had publicly said it would not allow ByteDance to divest TikTok’s recommendations algorithm and has enacted export control laws that would block such a spin-off.\\n“For the first time in history, Congress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban, and bars every American from participating in a unique online community with more than 1bn people worldwide,” the petition said.\\nCongress moved with unusual speed to pass the TikTok legislation, particularly after its members received classified briefings from security officials raising national security concerns. The bill passed despite aggressive lobbying efforts by TikTok, which galvanised its own users and creators to come out in favour of the app.\\nTikTok said in the petition that it had invested $2bn in “Project Texas”, its corporate restructuring plan to protect US user data from Chinese influence through a partnership with Oracle. It had also made “extraordinary, additional commitments” in a 90-page draft security agreement developed with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.\\nHowever, it said that Cfius had stopped meaningfully engaging with the platform in August 2022, while “Congress tossed this tailored agreement aside, in favour of the politically expedient and punitive approach”.\\nRecommended\\nTikTok successfully sued the US government in 2020 when then-president Donald Trump issued an executive order to ban the app, giving ByteDance 90 days to divest from its American assets and any data that TikTok had collected in the country.\\nRepublican congressman John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the strategic competition between the US and Chinese Communist party, said in a statement that he was “confident” that the legislation would be upheld.\\n“Congress and the executive branch have concluded, based on both publicly available and classified information, that TikTok poses a grave risk to national security and the American people.

       "  (Document(text='\\nJohn Thornhill\\nWhen Washington looks at China, it tends to see an ideological, interventionist, authoritarian superpower that favours its own companies while subverting foreign rivals. When it looks in the mirror, Washington sees the US as a pragmatic, capitalistic, democratic superpower that champions free speech and robust competition. When it comes to the narrow treatment of TikTok in the US and Tesla in China, however, those stereotypes appear to have blurred. It is the US that is becoming more dogmatic while China is becoming more pragmatic.\\nLast week, President Joe Biden signed a law that will ban TikTok from US platforms unless its Chinese parent company ByteDance sells the business to an approved buyer. In a rare display of bipartisan unity, Congress argued that ownership of the video-sharing platform by a Chinese-related company endangered national security. Who knew that Zach King’s flying wizard tricks or Bella Poarch’s lip-syncing videos were so worrisome?\\nTikTok provides a slick short-form video service used by 170mn Americans and 7mn businesses, much to the annoyance of US rivals such as Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat, which have doubtless been dripping poison in politicians’ ears. It has also gone to great lengths to try to convince US lawmakers that users’ data is safe and free from foreign manipulation. Over nearly three years, it has spent $1.5bn on building a ringfenced data infrastructure in the US in partnership with Oracle.\\nNevertheless, there remain some strong reasons for banning TikTok. The first is the principle of reciprocity. Beijing has previously blocked US social media apps, including Facebook, Instagram and X, in China so it can hardly object if Washington strongarms TikTok. The company also admits that China-based ByteDance employees have accessed some TikTok data in the US for operational purposes. A recent FT report highlighted how ByteDance had tightened its grip over TikTok’s US operations over the past two years.\\nMoreover, TikTok has only reinforced congressional fears about political interference by campaigning so energetically against the ban. Researchers have found that, compared with Instagram, there is a tendency for content on TikTok about Taiwan and Ukraine to be downplayed while videos that chime with official Chinese and Iranian views are boosted. “We assess a strong possibility that content on TikTok is either amplified or suppressed based on its alignment with the interests of the Chinese government,” concluded a report published last December by the Network Contagion Research Institute at Rutgers University. TikTok said at the time: “The report uses a flawed methodology to reach a predetermined, false conclusion.”\\nBut US aggression towards TikTok contrasts with China’s accommodation of Tesla. Last Sunday, Elon Musk met China’s premier Li Qiang and clinched a favourable agreement with the tech giant Baidu to access its mapping and navigation systems. Tesla’s chief executive’s grand ambition is to turn the company from a hardware into a software powerhouse. Autonomous driving will be critical to that transition and having access to Chinese data will help. If Tesla could apply autonomy across a vast fleet of cars “it might be the biggest asset value appreciation in history”, Musk gushed on Tesla’s latest earnings call .\\nWhy Musk should play nice with China is clear. Why China should reciprocate, given its concerns about the security risks of Tesla’s Chinese fleet, is not so obvious, especially when domestic electric-vehicle manufacturers such as BYD see the US company as a deadly rival. But there may be good pragmatic reasons for wooing Tesla.\\nAnalysts suggest Beijing is keen to reignite foreign investment, which has fallen to a 30-year low. Tesla, which sank more than $2bn on building a gigafactory in Shanghai in 2019 and now has 1.6mn cars on Chinese roads, could contribute to reversing the trend. Tesla’s investment has also stimulated the development of China’s own EV industry. And reaching an understanding with Tesla on data security in connected cars may help nullify concern when China sells its own EVs abroad.\\nWhatever their rhetorical posturing, it is perhaps naive to expect consistency in the policy positions of Washington or Beijing. Naked self-interest is normally a better guide to any nation’s actions, meaning both countries are sometimes flexible on points of principle. Wherever they can, the US and China adhere to the power law identified by the Greek historian Thucydides centuries ago: “The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.”\\njohn.thornhill@ft.com\\n', metadata={'query': 'Legal considerations surrounding password sharing', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/0e84f6b5-8b91-4bbb-9069-87e784675e17', 'title': 'What TikTok and Tesla tell us about pragmatism in the US and China', 'publication_time': '2024-05-02T13:48:54.980Z'}, uuid=UUID('d8f9aa31-e50c-4f93-b7aa-957f029f1c77'), db_id=''),\n",

Eight years later, after his federal trial concluded, he stands convicted of a civil insider trading charge. Panuwat’s company, Medivation, was bought in 2016 by Pfizer for $14bn. But the stock he purchased at the time was not that of Medivation.\\nRather he acquired shares of another life sciences company Incyte. Its shares jumped 8 per cent on the Medivation deal. Panuwat quickly cashed out Incyte call options for a $100,000 profit.\\nThe Feds said that the executive held material non-public information about Incyte — that it would benefit from merger speculation — which he had a duty not to trade on. It was a theory Panuwat rejected as factually false and not even prohibited by existing securities law.\\nBut his conviction should be a warning to companies, investment banks, law firms and the like that allow employees to own stocks even as they have broad knowledge of private, market-moving information.\\nPanuwat, for his part, says his purchase of Incyte shares had nothing to do with the sale of Medivation, where he was in the middle of deal discussions. He was a former investment banker who closely followed the industry and made a canny trade, in his telling.\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission insists there is nothing revolutionary about its case. Panuwat signed a confidentiality agreement with his employer which he breached when he traded in Incyte. The agency said Medivation had been defrauded by Panuwat’s actions and that overall confidence in the market had been undermined.\\nThe US does not have a specific insider trading prohibition. Rather it relies on anti-fraud statutes based on theories of theft and misuse of information. What is truly non-public information and who owes a duty to whom then become the central points in a prosecution. Those questions, as Panuwat demonstrates, can be thorny. How certain could he have been that Incyte would rise on the Medivation deal news?\\nCompanies warn their employees about trading in their employer’s shares. But, presumably, those admonitions now need to be broadened to a wider universe.

       "  (Document(text='\\nTabby Kinder and Hannah Murphy in San Francisco\\nTikTok workers in the US have been saddled with millions of dollars in tax liabilities on shares they are unable to sell, at a time when the Chinese-owned video-sharing app is battling a potential US ban.\\nByteDance, the app’s Beijing-based parent, is facing a backlash from US employees over a stock awards programme that blocks them from cashing in their shares while leaving them exposed to a large potential tax bill, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former workers.\\nThe frustrations pit some of TikTok’s US workers against the company at a sensitive time for its leadership. The US Senate is weighing a bill that would force the sale of the app over national security concerns, or have it banned.\\nNnete Matima, who in August left her job as a TikTok sales executive, said she was on the hook for a “potentially substantial” tax bill. “There are people who have a six-figure tax liability on [income] that they have never received,” she said.\\nOne of those people is Patrick Spaulding Ryan, who worked at ByteDance as a manager between 2020 and 2022, and must pay a tax bill of more than $100,000 on shares he has been unable to sell.\\n“This is a horribly managed company,” said Spaulding Ryan. He has sent letters of complaint to the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor and the Securities and Exchange Commission about ByteDance’s handling of share awards.\\nByteDance acknowledged employees’ concerns in a memo to US staff on Saturday, arguing that its tax practices are “compliant” with US law. External law firms and a Big Four accounting firm have assessed the share-based pay scheme, the memo said.\\nByteDance aims to provide “significant buyback opportunities based on the company’s situations each year”, the memo to staff said.\\n“Our goals are to address the liquidity issue for [restricted stock units] in the US, provide competitive compensation and enable employees to benefit from the company’s growth,” it added.\\nHowever, ByteDance is unlikely to organise a large financing round from investors to buy employee shares or carry out an initial public offering while its future in the US is uncertain.\\nA TikTok spokesperson said: “We strictly adhere to the requirements of US tax laws. Given this is the first tax year after this buyback program was launched, we also have provided an on-call service for employees to have their questions and concerns addressed.”\\nThe Chinese group has about 7,000 workers in the US, plus thousands of former employees. Globally, ByteDance employees own 20 per cent of its shares, according to a company statement last year.\\nIt has regularly granted shares to employees in the form of restricted stock units. RSUs have no tangible value until they are vested, at which time they are assigned a fair market value and are taxed as ordinary income in that year.\\nBillions of dollars of ByteDance RSUs vested last year after the group, in an effort to appease employees, waived a “liquidity event” trigger for the stock units. This meant workers no longer needed to wait for the company to list publicly before cashing in their shares, said several people familiar with the matter.\\nHowever, the move also meant share awards then became subject to income tax. The number of RSUs ByteDance withheld to cover the tax liabilities was insufficient in many cases, leaving many individuals needing to make an additional cash payment to the Internal Revenue Service.\\nSince then, ByteDance has held only small buyback programmes — in some cases offering to buy shares far below the value at which they will be taxed, according to ex-staff — and has restricted individuals from selling their shares to outside investors.\\nByteDance’s valuation meanwhile soared from about $100bn in 2020 to $268bn in December 2023, prompting those employees who were granted RSUs years ago to expect a windfall when they vested them. Instead, the lack of liquidity has meant large numbers of people are unable to sell shares to cover their tax liabilities.\\nSome former employees have been told their stock is worth about 20 per cent less than those held by current staff, but they still owe tax based on the higher price.\\nByteDance has imposed strict non-disparagement clauses on employees receiving stock awards, blocking them from criticising the company and complicating any challenge.\\nMatima, who is suing ByteDance for alleged racial discrimination, said she was considering her legal options over the tax issue. TikTok has said that it takes employee concerns “very seriously” and has a strong record of “championing diversity and inclusion”.\\nTikTok’s US business denies it shares data related to its US users with entities in China. However, the dispute over RSUs shows that may not be the case for information about its US employees.\\nSeveral current and former employees said they were unable to access and review information easily about their shares in the company, noting the ownership details are managed via ByteDance’s China-based stock platform.\\nOther tech start-ups have made arrangements to help staff pay tax bills on vested RSUs.\\nLast year, payments business Stripe arranged a $6.5bn deal that allowed employees to sell the number of shares necessary to cover the tax liability on vested RSUs. Instacart, a grocery delivery start-up, carried out an IPO in part to create liquidity for employees who had been granted RSUs.\\nIn December, ByteDance offered to buy back roughly $5bn of employees’ vested shares. Former workers claimed the company’s formula for purchasing shares in the scheme was “arbitrary” or “unclear”.\\nByteDance has reported the fair market value of its shares at about $158 per share, according to a document seen by the Financial Times. However, five former staff members said the company late last year offered to buy back shares from current employees at $160 each, compared with $128 to those no longer working there.\\nIn another plan, ByteDance last month offered to purchase employees’ stock at about $171 each, or $145 based on the stockholder’s “employment or service relationship with the company”, according to a separate document seen by the FT.', metadata={'query': 'Legal considerations surrounding password sharing', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/18316e7c-accd-41dc-b469-1e8341e721fe', 'title': 'TikTok staff face big US tax bills on shares they cannot sell', 'publication_time': '2024-04-09T04:00:22.868Z'}, uuid=UUID('7e1f7d5e-f4dc-4c31-895e-a3a6fedb893f'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nLucy Warwick-Ching\\nI’m moving in with my partner for the first time and we plan to set up a joint account for practical reasons. Am I exposing myself to any risk financially? I’m concerned about sharing my money with someone else.\\nSarah Jane Boon, partner at Charles Russell Speechlys, says that while opening a joint account with your partner is a significant step in your financial journey together, it’s also sensible to be aware of the potential risks.\\nGenerally, when couples move in together two lives begin to merge, and each partner naturally becomes more involved in the other’s schedules, decisions and finances.\\nManaging finances together can also allow for better budgeting, as you and your partner track your expenses collectively and work together to establish realistic budgets that match your shared goals. Consolidating finances can streamline bill payments, savings and other financial responsibilities.\\nOf course, if you plan to have children or purchase a property together, joint accounts become even more of an inevitability due to shared outgoings and often a desire for greater visibility of your household’s overall financial position.\\nHowever, there are several issues to consider, which may not be immediately obvious. Joint accounts can expose both parties named on the account to potential financial risks, including liabilities from overdrafts, debts or associated legal issues. In the event of a break-up or divorce, dividing assets held in joint accounts can be complex and contentious.\\nWhat many don’t realise is that, legally, all money held in a joint bank account is owned by anyone named as an account holder. In most cases, withdrawals from the account only require one person’s authorisation and a party is not limited only to withdraw “their half” of a jointly held balance.\\nThis means it is entirely legal for one person to take money from the account without the other knowing, which can lead to significant disputes for couples going through divorce or separating (who often assume the balance held in the account will automatically be shared equally).\\nWith joint ownership comes shared responsibility for the account. If one partner overspends or mismanages funds, it can affect both individuals’ credit scores and financial wellbeing.\\nThat’s not to say that joint accounts are a bad thing. In the majority of cases, they are useful and practical and, when opened with a trusted partner or family member, can bring many saving and spending benefits.\\nBut before taking this step with your partner, you should engage in open and honest discussions about your financial values, goals and concerns.\\nMy wealthy aunt died recently at her home in London, leaving property assets there and in Switzerland, plus bank accounts, various overseas trusts and share portfolios. Her former nurse has produced the latest copy of my aunt’s will, of which she is a beneficiary to a larger extent than the family realised. We are concerned about the possibility it was changed recently due to malign influence. What should we do?\\nLaura Phillips, legal director at law firm Kingsley Napley , says a good first step would be to investigate the preparation and execution of your aunt’s will. For example, try to find out if it was prepared by a solicitor or will writer (the information would usually be found somewhere on the will). If so, try to obtain the will file containing attendance notes or instructions as to why your aunt made the decisions and legacies that she did.\\nThis may also show whether the nurse was present when instructions were given. If the will is homemade — for example, if no independent person was instructed to assist — try to gather information about your aunt’s demeanour and health when the will was made.\\nIf you have suspicions about the nurse’s influence over your aunt, there are several ways a will could be challenged in England and Wales. The rules are different in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Depending on the evidence, it is possible to bring claims for more than one of these types of issues.\\nThe first consideration is whether your aunt was suffering from a condition affecting her mental capacity, such as dementia. To make a will, a person must have capacity. Even if someone has a diagnosis of cognitive illness, however, this does not automatically mean they lack testamentary capacity. It will require a detailed review of the medical evidence and other contemporaneous documents to assess this.\\nIt is also possible that, even if your aunt did not suffer from such a condition, she may not have known and approved the entire contents of her will. For a will to be valid, the testator must be aware of its contents including all the details, however complex, and whichever gifts are specified.\\nI am going through the process of divorcing my husband and have found out he’s borrowed money, unbeknown to me, from his parents, to help pay our mortgage for the past few months due to our rate going up significantly. I thought our finances were relatively simple, but these soft loans have thrown our divorce agreement in a spin — am I liable to help pay back his parents, even though I had no knowledge of these loans?\\nFinally, you should consider whether your aunt may have been unduly influenced or coerced by her nurse. Undue influence claims are quite often pleaded but are very difficult to prove because the person who could give evidence that they were being coerced is deceased. However, contemporaneous documents such as medical records, diary entries, and the recollections of other people who were close to your aunt and may have had suspicions can be considered.\\nThe assets held in overseas trusts will not pass under your aunt’s will so you would need to consider the trust documents or contact the trustees to establish who are the beneficiaries of any trust assets following her death.\\nGiven your aunt also had assets in Switzerland, you should also obtain advice from a lawyer there to establish how the will (and any challenge to its validity) would be treated under Swiss law.\\nThe opinions in this column are intended for general information purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional advice.

       "  (Document(text='\\nKaye Wiggins\\nIn Hong Kong, a city that is adapting to life under a Beijing-imposed national security law and introducing its own version of it , global companies are bringing in practical barriers to doing business.\\nThe US law firm Latham & Watkins is cutting its lawyers off from international databases. Deloitte and KPMG are asking staff to take burner phones when they visit. Though the firms have not said explicitly why they have done this, several other global companies are discussing whether to take similar measures.\\nThese moves sometimes seem like overkill to affected staff, and to rival companies.\\xa0Frustrated consultants say it has not been made clear why they can’t use their devices, noting that systems can be hacked from anywhere and that rival Big Four companies don’t take the same approach. Lawyers at other international firms say they do not take the Latham & Watkins approach, and have no plans to.\\nThe problem is that many international businesses operating in Hong Kong are finding it harder than ever to understand what they need to worry about, and how much. In 2020, the US declared that it no longer considered Hong Kong to be autonomous from China. And now Beijing is prioritising security over economic growth.\\xa0Police and security services have raided the offices of foreign due diligence firms on the mainland and Beijing introduced anti-espionage and data-sharing laws that, according to foreign chambers of commerce, are too vague and make it hard for multinationals to carry out normal business — though China has sought to clarify the rules .\\n“There is so much uncertainty as to, is there a risk or isn’t there a risk?” a Hong Kong-based consultant said. “Is Hong Kong really part of China when it comes to data security? People just don’t know. Some people are quite blasé about it\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009others are taking quite an extreme position.”\\nThe uncertainty encourages companies to take a risk-averse approach. At some, there is a tussle between Asia-based partners who fear that introducing practical barriers will damage their business and alienate Chinese investors, and their US colleagues who are increasingly wary about China. The information vacuum favours the latter.\\nLast week Hong Kong published a detailed draft proposal of its own national security law, targeting espionage, treason and foreign political influence, a requirement under Article 23 of the Basic Law, which took effect after the 1997 handover. The bill is set to broaden the definition of state secrets to include data on the economic, social or technological development of Hong Kong or the mainland. The government had previously been holding meetings to brief business figures on the Article 23 plans. But it “hasn’t come out and said definitively, ‘this is OK and this isn’t’”, one said.\\nFor years, Hong Kong’s international finance crowd has seemed to exist in a parallel universe to conversations about politics, but sentiment is starting to change. Political rhetoric in the territory is rattling many expats. Hong Kong chief executive John Lee has referred to a group of pro-democracy activists, who are self-exiled in the US, UK and Australia, as “street rats” and police have offered bounties for information leading to their arrest.\\n“Until now, someone like me who has no participation in politics has felt completely safe,” a senior expat banker said. “My assumption is they will leave me alone, because I’m not meddling in that part of the world. But there’s a question mark, right? Hong Kong has a whole bunch of firms that do due diligence — what if one of them pisses someone off?”\\nBurner phones and data curbs are unsettling, and a ban on disparaging China in initial public offering prospectuses has forced bankers in Hong Kong to think carefully about language. The uncertainty and tough rhetoric have got them speculating about other scenarios, too.\\xa0One asked recently whether I thought Hong Kong expats might face travel bans, as some executives have done in mainland China, especially if they work on due diligence projects in which they might handle sensitive information about Chinese companies. Another said they wondered whether WhatsApp could be banned.\\nOfficials have said they have “no intention” to ban any social media platforms under the new law. And it is difficult to know what reassurance Hong Kong’s government might offer. But it matters for Hong Kong’s global standing that people are raising these questions.\\xa0“When I travel to Singapore it doesn’t occur to me to think, shall I take my phone?” the banker said. “People don’t think about it in London or Sydney. I think it’s very hard to be a regional centre if that’s how people start thinking.”\\nkaye.wiggins@ft.com', metadata={'query': 'Legal considerations surrounding password sharing', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/d6b09e2f-e982-4e28-a667-a7d14678daf6', 'title': 'In Hong Kong, companies do not know what to worry about or why', 'publication_time': '2024-03-12T00:01:48.100Z'}, uuid=UUID('bb8e92b5-2c31-4b28-aa34-8a218d5eb1d8'), db_id=''),\n",

The indictment, which was unsealed in a California federal court on Wednesday, alleged that Ding “began secretly uploading trade secrets that were stored in Google’s network” between May 2022 and May 2023, “by which time Ding allegedly uploaded more than 500 unique files containing confidential information”.\\nThe technology Ding allegedly stole involved the “building blocks” of Google’s AI infrastructure, prosecutors said. As an employee, Ding had been granted access to Google’s “confidential information related to the hardware infrastructure, the software platform and the AI models and applications they supported”, according to a press release announcing the indictment.\\nDing was arrested on Wednesday in Newark, California, and charged with four counts of theft of trade secrets. He faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for each count if convicted.\\n“We have strict safeguards to prevent the theft of our confidential commercial information and trade secrets,” Google said in a statement. “After an investigation, we found that this employee stole numerous documents, and we quickly referred the case to law enforcement. We are grateful to the FBI for helping protect our information and will continue co-operating with them closely.”\\nGoogle is among the Big Tech groups investing tens billions of dollars to develop generative AI products that have the potential to transform technology and other industries. An arms race for AI dominance kicked off last year when Microsoft invested $10bn in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.\\nThe case also comes as tensions have increased over Silicon Valley’s links to China. The Biden administration has moved to ban some US investment into China’s quantum computing , advanced chips and AI sectors in an effort to stop the Chinese military from accessing American technology and capital. It will largely affect private equity and venture capital firms. In advance of that, some US investors with large operations in the country, such as Sequoia Capital and GGV Capital, have spun off their Chinese businesses.\\nThe US attorney’s office in San Francisco in recent years charged three former Apple employees with stealing trade secrets related to self-driving car technology for Chinese companies.\\n“Today’s charges are the latest illustration of the lengths affiliates of companies based in the People’s Republic of China are willing to go to steal American innovation,” FBI director Christopher Wray said in a statement.\\nDuring his employment at Google, Ding secretly affiliated himself with two China-based tech companies, according to the indictment. It alleged he helped raise capital for one of the companies during a five-month trip to China in late 2022. Potential investors were told he was offered the position of its chief technology officer and owned 20 per cent of its stock, prosecutors said.\\nHe also allegedly founded his own AI and machine learning company and applied to a China-based incubation programme. Ding travelled to Beijing to present his company at an investor conference in November, prosecutors said.\\nThe indictment stated that he took steps to evade detection by Google’s data loss prevention systems, and also permitted another Google employee to use his work access badge to scan into a Google building, making it appear as if he was working from the US Google office when he was in China.\\nComments have not been enabled for this article.', metadata={'query': 'Legal considerations surrounding password sharing', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/68abfd2d-2fb1-4e0a-8068-22e581adbb51', 'title': 'Google engineer charged with stealing AI secrets while working for Chinese groups', 'publication_time': '2024-03-06T23:01:39.051Z'}, uuid=UUID('743d43c9-2d8a-4c88-87ac-edcc2e8ce39a'), db_id=''),\n",

In November 2021, the US commerce department placed Israel’s NSO Group , the private equity-backed company that pioneered the industry, on a blacklist.\\n“Travel to the United States is an important element for those that are involved in the sector and that are involved in technology broadly,” a senior US official said. “And we want to make sure that there is accountability for those who are involved in both the misuse or enabling the misuse, which is an important element of this.”\\nThe government has already listed this sort of spyware — which can bypass the encryption on modern smartphones to mirror their content remotely — as a threat to its national security. By March 2023, at least 50 government employees working overseas had been found to have been surveilled surreptitiously by spyware, raising counter-intelligence concerns.\\nThe US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, declined to say if more had been discovered since then. But the Biden administration has taken an increasingly tough stance on the manufacturers of spyware, most of whom are based in Israel, a close ally that classifies it as a weapon. Israel regulates its sale to its own allies.\\nIt is unclear what impact those policies have had on preventing the spyware from being deployed on dissidents, journalists and human rights advocates. Last week, an NGO called Access Now, working with Citizen Lab, a watchdog group at the University of Toronto, found that at least 35 people in Jordan, which receives large amount of US financial and military assistance, had been targeted with the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware.\\nThose included researchers at Human Rights Watch and Daoud Kuttab, a renowned radio journalist in Amman, whose phone was repeatedly hacked with Pegasus between February 2022 and September 2023.\\nRecommended\\nThe commerce department blacklisting of NSO — which cut the company off from any dealings with the US companies that it relied on for servers and IT equipment — combined with the 2022 executive order scuppered a possible sale of the company to a US defence contractor, two people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times last year.\\n“We cannot speak to any specific country or individuals based on the way this operates,” said the US official. “But this is an important signal that we’re also sending, to not those not just those that are misusing, but those that are involved in enabling the misuse.”\\nNSO, which was not mentioned by name in this order, has continued to operate, and rivals have sprung up in EU countries, including Greece and Cyprus.

It was quickly disavowed by the agency, which announced its bona fide approvals a day later.\\nThe SEC on Monday said it determined that an unauthorised party had deployed an apparent “SIM swap”, which involves transferring a mobile phone number to a different device without the owner’s permission. The password for the SEC’s account on X was then changed.\\nThe number transfer occurred via the telecommunications carrier rather than through the agency’s systems, the SEC said. The regulator added it had not found any evidence that the hacker gained access to its systems, devices, data or other social media accounts.\\nThe agency also disclosed that X in July had disabled multi-factor authentication at the SEC’s request “due to issues accessing the account”. The procedure was reinstated after the page was breached and was enabled for all SEC social media accounts offering such authentication, the regulator said.\\nThe mishap was an embarrassment for the agency after its chair Gary Gensler made cyber security a pillar of his agenda, adopting rules that require businesses be more vigilant about cyber risks.\\nWhile the hack was not serious by cyber standards, given that it did not affect the SEC’s own systems, analysts found the absence of two-factor authentication, first disclosed by X, to be an easily avoidable faux pas. “We encourage all users to enable this extra layer of security,” X said the day of the incident.\\nRecommended\\nThe fake post came as Wall Street eagerly awaited SEC authorisation of the first-ever spot bitcoin ETFs, which enable ordinary investors to hold the cryptocurrency in their brokerage accounts. Gensler has expressed scepticism over crypto, calling the markets the “wild west”.\\nGensler has adopted a tough enforcement stance against crypto and argued that many digital tokens are securities that fall directly within the agency’s purview.\\xa0The SEC already regulates ETFs.\\nThe day of the hack, Gensler posted on his own X account 10 minutes after the fake post was published, saying the regulator’s account had been “compromised” and no ETF approvals had been granted.\\nThe regulator on Monday said it was still co-ordinating with law enforcement as well as federal agencies including the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. According to the SEC, the probe’s focus includes how the hacker had the telecoms carrier change the SIM and how they became aware of the account’s number.', metadata={'query': 'Legal considerations surrounding password sharing', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/587df5c6-43b7-47df-b283-296ac4a04a26', 'title': '\\u200bSEC says false bitcoin post came after phone number was switched', 'publication_time': '2024-01-22T21:01:35.706Z'}, uuid=UUID('59c8c5d9-e425-492c-ba8c-8674a7db1f57'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nJamie Schafer\\nGet ahead with daily markets updates.\\nThe writer is a partner at Perkins Coie\\nAs an anti-money laundering lawyer, I’ve frequently heard it said that the new US Corporate Transparency Act — which requires certain corporations, limited liability companies and similar entities to disclose beneficial ownership information to the US Department of the Treasury for the first time — won’t make a difference. The reason? The “Tony Sopranos” of this world aren’t going to report anyway.\\nBut this misunderstands perhaps the most important potential impact of the CTA, which goes into effect on January 1: dismantling the infrastructure that enables financial crimes by imposing liability on the corporate service providers or “gatekeepers” (lawyers, trustees, accountants and other corporate service providers) that allow (often unwittingly) the Sopranos to hide and launder billions of dollars.\\xa0The law will result in substantial new enforcement risk for the organisations and individuals typically involved in supporting or helping to create US entities.\\nIn 2014, an investigator posing as the representative of a corrupt foreign government met 16 Manhattan lawyers to request help moving millions in suspicious funds into the US. All but one in effect provided a road map on how to launder the money through shell corporations.\\nWhile the results of the sting were shocking, there were no regulations or even ethical rules that clearly require lawyers — or other corporate service providers — to “know their customers”.\\xa0The CTA changes this by creating a federal disclosure requirement necessitating, at least to some degree, that lawyers, trustees, accountants and others declare their association with the entities they create and, to some extent, understand their true owners.\\nThe CTA stipulates that individuals who create new entities be reported to the government as “company applicants”. This means corporate service providers will be associated in a federal database in perpetuity with the entities they create, and potentially with any future misdeeds of those entities.\\nMoreover, in the context of CTA filings, corporate service providers also face liability with respect to any failure or falsehood regarding the true ownership and control of the entities they support.\\nPenalties for non-compliance with the CTA are steep, including daily accumulation of civil penalties and criminal sentences of up to two years’ imprisonment.\\nUS authorities have stated that the scope of liability under the CTA encompasses any individual who can be said to have “caused” a violation of the act, including by submitting a false or fraudulent filing on behalf of an entity they assist. Yet significant ambiguities persist, including around how broadly regulators will interpret “wilfulness” or “wilful blindness” on the part of those involved in CTA filings.\\nFor instance, lawyers or corporate service providers filing false or incomplete information where there were obvious red flags as to an entity’s ownership or control by, for example, a Russian oligarch, could certainly come under fire.\\nBut what are regulators’ expectations of such firms? What best practices will they be expected to adopt in verifying that they know the true beneficial owners of entities in complex corporate webs spanning multiple jurisdictions?\\nThis is a new frontier for the corporate services industry. And, while it is easy for a lawyer such as myself with an anti-money laundering background to identify these risks, most of those involved in corporate formation and administration do not have experience with these issues. For this reason, there is not yet a robust appreciation throughout the industry of the multitude of risks that CTA reporting may lay bare.\\nThat’s why gatekeeper entities and individuals should take a close look at their vetting procedures and be vigilant about red flags as they gather ownership information to prepare CTA reports.\\xa0These may range from the seemingly obvious — “why would someone with this amount of wealth have no internet presence?” — to more complex issues such as overly complicated ownership structures, extensive use of intermediaries and arrangements that involve “offshore” jurisdictions for no clear business or tax reason.\\nCurrently, there is confusion across the corporate services industry. The most responsible providers are implementing robust new vetting and compliance programmes while more lax competitors are still wondering, “what does this have to do with me?”\\xa0You can guess which one is going to get the oligarch business next year — and then find themselves in the enforcement crosshairs in the years to come.', metadata={'query': 'Legal considerations surrounding password sharing', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/25478f33-f73c-424f-a3ad-84cbb4fc50c2', 'title': 'Gatekeepers beware: the new US corporate transparency act could be a game-changer', 'publication_time': '2023-12-18T15:13:03.965Z'}, uuid=UUID('850f56a1-2d7d-4326-a635-5fa76335d7b5'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nSoumaya Keynes\\nWhat if the government made companies hand a slice of their profits to workers? In Britain and America, the question is about as live as the pigeon that met my cat. But the idea is not crazy. Plenty of governments offer tax breaks to encourage profit-sharing. And in some countries, including Peru, Mexico and France (bien sur), they go all the way, forcing businesses to share spoils with staff. New evidence sheds light on the consequences.\\nProfit-sharing has two main aims. The one sung around leftie campfires is that it will motivate staff and enhance productivity. (Sounds lovely, though it is a bit unclear why the government would have to push companies to do it.) The other aim is blunter: to redistribute from capital to labour.\\nEvidence that it can deliver either has been hard to come by. Academics have found correlations between profit-sharing and productivity, but not much concrete evidence of what exactly causes what. One 2001 study found that after Continental Airlines offered a bonus for hitting company-wide targets, performance did improve. But the authors argued that this was because of staff carrying out “mutual monitoring”. In other businesses it might be easier to freeride.\\nShareholders worried about a raid on their profits might warn of some nasty unintended consequences. Any tax advantages, as exist in France, will cost the Treasury. (The British government ditched a voluntary “profit-related pay” scheme in the 1990s after it became a vehicle for tax avoidance.) And businesses can always cut wages, leaving employees with income that is more volatile but no higher. Lower retained profits could crimp investment. Or, as with any regulation, companies might contort to avoid paying up.\\nIn Mexico, where profit-sharing is a constitutional obligation, contortion has been common. Rafael Avante, a Mexican labour lawyer, explains that historically companies have avoided regulations by using informal labour as well as hiring workers through subsidiaries. The latter in effect protects the parent company’s profits. The government recently tried to ban bogus subcontracting, at which point employers demanded a cap on any profits to be shared.\\nIn France, there have been distortions too. Their scheme requires big companies to share a fraction of “excess” profits with workers, defined as those above 5 per cent of equity value. In 2019, around two-fifths of the workforce got payouts. But as a new working paper finds, in the late 1980s when only companies with more than 100 employees were affected, there was a suspicious cluster of businesses around that threshold.\\nThat study also assesses the effects of a French reform in 1991, which expanded the law’s coverage to businesses with 50-99 employees. They compare the newly affected companies with those below and above the new and old thresholds, and so can isolate forced profit-shifting’s effects.\\nDavid Sraer of the University of California, Berkeley, one of the authors, was surprised to find that investment did not drop in the affected companies. Disappointingly, productivity didn’t rise either. And happily, on average the affected workers did seem to benefit from higher income. Four-fifths of that was paid for by shareholders. Taxpayers funded the rest.\\nBefore finance bros in the Anglosphere start clamouring for policymakers to don berets, they should probably note a few caveats. The results might not hold for bigger companies, or could fade over time. More importantly for them, among highly paid workers the bump in income was not statistically distinguishable from zero. Instead, it was concentrated among low- and middle-earners. Sraer and his co-authors think that is because rigid minimum wages made it harder for managers to squash pay.\\nSraer suggests that the scheme has another benefit: it turns employees into corporation tax enforcement officers. In France, workers hire consultancies to make sure that they are not being stiffed by creative corporate accounting. That should discourage companies from trying to cook their books.\\nThe French experience offers another lesson, based on a comparison of voluntary profit-sharing schemes and the mandatory version. A recent report from the French Council of Economic Analysis finds that the voluntary sort seems to come with “significant” substitution for wages. Camille Landais, an author, reckons that companies use the flexibility they are given to time payouts around pay negotiations in a way that does not raise overall pay. It doesn’t seem worth the state subsidising that.\\nFor any political party eager to torch a reputation for being business friendly, profit-sharing schemes are an option. But if they want to redistribute effectively, it seems the only way is with a heavy hand.\\nsoumaya.keynes@ft.com\\nFollow Soumaya Keynes with myFT and on X', metadata={'query': 'Legal considerations surrounding password sharing', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/1958b4f9-4f65-47d7-9774-9179142070f8', 'title': 'Should businesses have to share profits with employees?', 'publication_time': '2023-12-01T05:00:17.172Z'}, uuid=UUID('79fe3b9f-874f-41ab-89d4-dc328a54a184'), db_id=''),\n",

The company said on Wednesday that the effort to limit password sharing had boosted its subscriber and revenue growth over the past two quarters, adding that the “cancel reaction” had been lower than expected.\\nThe subscriber increase was the strongest quarterly rise since the second quarter of 2020, when Covid-19 lockdowns led to a jump in sign-ups.\\n“The ‘streamflation’ era is upon us, and consumers should expect to be hit with price hikes [and] password sharing limits, and enticed with ad supported options,” said Scott Purdy, KPMG’s media leader, on Wednesday. “Today’s results show that these levers are working, at least in the short term.”\\nBut Netflix said its advertising initiative has been slower to take off, repeating an earlier forecast that ad revenue would not be “material” in 2023.

In total, operating margin is now expected to come in at 20 per cent for the year, at the top end of the company’s guidance.\\nBut as Netflix concedes, 2023 is “a pretty unusual year”. Most of its revenue growth has come from member growth. What happens when all the free riders have stumped up — or opted to read a good book instead.\\nPrice increases will help. But the effects may be limited given the largest share of membership growth comes from countries where plans cost less. Despite the jump in net subscribers during the third quarter, average revenue per member fell 1 per cent year over year.\\nEven free cash flow, which is expected to come in at an impressive $6.5bn this year, looks temporary. The number, up from $1.6bn in 2022, is boosted by lower spending on content as a result of the Hollywood writers’ strike.\\nEfforts to build up an advertising revenue stream remains a work in progress. Price increases for ad-free streaming are clearly aimed at steering more viewers towards ad-supported plans.\\nThe problem is this is a crowded space, with rivals including Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal and Warner Bros.

It banned some investment and imposed government notification requirements on other areas.\\nIn recent weeks American banks, manufacturers and industry groups have registered some concerns with the Treasury, which has the role of writing the rules that will implement Biden’s executive order. They have warned of uncertainty from how the restrictions have been laid out and the potential harm to domestic innovation, while lobbying to narrow some provisions or expand carve-outs for some types of investments.\\n“We no longer want to give an unlimited green light for investors to unwittingly threaten our national security,” Andy Barr, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the House financial institutions subcommittee, told the Financial Times. “At the same time we don’t need a clunky, bureaucratic process that freezes out cross-border capital flows in ways that undermine our commitment to a market-based economy.”\\nOne of the parts of the proposed rules that has sparked much concern is a carve-out for US limited partners (LP) — the endowments, pension funds and charities that put money into venture funds. Lawyers say the rule will probably allow American LP capital to continue flowing into Chinese start-ups in all three sensitive sectors, provided that the venture capitalists directing the investment are Chinese or European and not American.\\n“The rules will potentially create disadvantages for US investors,” said George Grammas, a lawyer at Squire Patton Boggs.\\nThe National Venture Capital Association, a group representing more than 400 American VC groups, warned that the measures would leave its members at a disadvantage against foreign rivals in the “fierce and global” fight to raise money from pension funds, endowments and other institutional investors.\\nThe NVCA is pushing Washington to expand the exemption to include venture capital managers as well, provided they are not taking substantial or controlling stakes in Chinese start-ups that pose security risks.\\n“Without this change, much of the same LP capital will still reach many of the same Chinese companies (via foreign venture funds) without US funds being able to obtain a corresponding understanding of the state of the international market,” the association said in a filed comment with Treasury.\\nWhile US officials have said they do not intend to impose restrictions on LPs if their contributions are purely financial, the Treasury plans to set a threshold. The investment would have to be below that level to be allowed.\\nBut the Institutional Limited Partners Association, representing investors with $3tn in assets, is pushing to do away with any threshold for its members’ passive investments to qualify for the exemption.\\nUncertainty around the order has curtailed American LP interest in China. Venture capitalists expect US dollar backing for China-focused funds to remain tight until the final rules are released, which lawyers said could take up to a year.\\nData from Preqin shows dollar investment in China venture and private equity groups has dried up. The $5.7bn raised this year is about a quarter of last year’s total and a fraction of the $48bn raised in 2021. Beijing’s crackdown on tech followed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had already unnerved foreign investors.\\nThe comments in response to the proposed rules highlight the complexity of untangling US investment from sensitive areas of China’s tech sector.\\nOne US venture capital manager said his fund was “caught in the middle” of US-China decoupling. “There’s this perception that US venture capital is funding breakthrough tech [in China]. But that’s wrong,” he said. “The companies that we’re funding are not in a position to advance China’s national interest. We’re investing in consumer start-ups and food delivery.”\\nBut others say US companies must be more cognisant of national security. Some lawmakers, including House China Committee chair Mike Gallagher, have called for a ban on investment in Chinese capital markets. Illustrating the possible risks, the FT last week reported that Vanguard , the world’s second-largest asset manager, was channelling investment into 60 companies connected to China’s military-industrial complex.\\nEric Sayers, an Asia security expert at Beacon Global Strategies consultancy, said administration officials and lawmakers arguing for an outbound investment tool viewed it as critical to tackling “existential national security issue” related to China.\\n“Even if a new regime at Treasury creates a new burdensome process for business, this is an acceptable cost for the hawks who believe limiting investment into key sectors in China is essential to containing the long-term military capacity of the People’s Liberation Army,” Sayers said.\\nResponses to the Treasury’s consultation from trade bodies and investment banks including Goldman Sachs also claimed that the rules too broadly define industries where technology has dual commercial and military uses, such as AI.\\n“I don’t think it’s the intention [of the order] to stop [all] investment, but it will be the outcome unless these definitions are tightened up,” said one person lobbying for clearer rules on behalf of investors.', metadata={'query': 'Legal considerations surrounding password sharing', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/66f344cd-fbfd-42b2-8b72-acdba52d0922', 'title': 'US groups lobby to refine proposed limits on China investment', 'publication_time': '2023-10-20T04:00:48.353Z'}, uuid=UUID('fab732fa-90b3-4831-8f96-7afb098e9583'), db_id=''),\n",

The moral argument is that all exchange is voluntary.\\nParty A cannot coerce party B into providing labour or goods at a price that does not command party B’s unforced consent.\\nHowever, for party B’s freedom of contract to be meaningful, it must have alternatives to trading with party A. If party B’s options are restricted, the voluntarism of its trading is illusory. Adam Smith, the 18th-century Scottish economist and philosopher, addressed this in his conception of natural liberty and his advocacy of competition in his book The Wealth of Nations : “In general, if any branch of trade, or any division of labour, be advantageous to the public, the freer and more general the competition, it will always be the more so.”\\nThis stands in contrast to the prevailing focus on consumer welfare, where the cost of goods is the main criteria for antitrust enforcement. There are undeniably trade-offs between economies of scale, which can deliver goods at lower cost in some industries, and an abundance of choice, and there may be instances where the former is preferable.\\nBut it is sensible to recognise the trade-off and reconnect competition policy with the moral roots of the system it is regulating.\\nDaniel Aronoff Research Scientist, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, MA, US', metadata={'query': 'Legal considerations surrounding password sharing', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/ad6a7509-3b1f-4b48-9917-24fc97bdedd3', 'title': 'Letter: US antitrust and the moral justification for capitalism', 'publication_time': '2023-10-16T01:03:22.731Z'}, uuid=UUID('1251b6d0-21c1-4198-9781-aba286eed514'), db_id=''),\n",

But the presence of so many employee details on underground forums underlines the risk that large corporations like MGM face from the varied and constantly evolving methods that hackers use to gain access to networks.\\n“For such large and profitable companies like MGM and Caesars, they would have had the resources available to protect their data and customers,” said Andrew Martin, chief executive at Dynarisk. “They could have done things to prevent this breach that were relatively simple, including if they had been monitoring for these credentials being stolen and acted [promptly], the whole thing could have been prevented.”\\nThe login and passwords in the data set were probably stolen from a computer infected with a malware called Redline , according to Dynarisk, which hides behind pirated copies of video games or other software. The MGM IT employee’s password for his company login was “K@sper99!” and a Caesars IT employee’s was “W@lmart1”.\\nRedline also steals and packages freshly stolen cookies, the tiny pieces of information that browsers use to identify frequent visitors to websites so that users do not have to enter their login details repeatedly.\\nA person claiming to represent a hacking group nicknamed Scattered Spider told the Financial Times on Thursday that it had carried out the breach at MGM, including trying to tamper with the casino resort’s slot machines.\\nThe group is allegedly behind at least 100 attacks on major US corporations and is considered a major threat to western companies.\\nIts members, mostly English-speaking hackers from the US and Europe, are known to impersonate an employee they have studied over social media in phone calls to company help desks where they try to generate fresh passwords.\\nIn this instance, the person claiming to represent Scattered Spider said it had also compromised an employee’s phone number, allowing it to reroute a text message containing a one time password to the hackers, instead of the employee.\\nThe stolen passwords and logins were for a system called Okta, made by the eponymous identity management company based in San Francisco, whose software is used by thousands of businesses to verify their employees’ identity before granting access to internal company websites.\\nA dark web site tied to a group that Scattered Spider has sometimes worked with said on Friday that “MGM made the hasty decision to shut down each and every one of their Okta servers after learning we had been lurking on their Okta servers”.\\n“Although we cannot speak to the MGM event, we have seen social engineering attacks involving a threat actor calling an organisation’s help desk, impersonating an employee, and persuading the help desk to reset multi-factor authentication for a highly privileged account,” said a spokesperson for Okta, referring to the accounts of either senior employees at companies, or people working in the IT departments whose accounts would have greater access to the rest of the companies’ networks.\\nDynarisk’s Martin said more companies were at risk — other data sets he had seen traded recently included credentials for employees at more than 500 other companies, including those at Wells Fargo, WPP, Experian, Diageo, Wayfair, Epic Games and Adobe.\\n“More of these hacks are coming,” he said.', metadata={'query': 'Legal considerations surrounding password sharing', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/3428d3b3-7283-4650-bd5d-2120b52f70cd', 'title': 'MGM and Caesars employees’ logins ‘hacked and traded’ on cybercriminal forums', 'publication_time': '2023-09-15T12:21:31.983Z'}, uuid=UUID('0177784e-9c3e-48a3-9701-352ac5aa6273'), db_id=''),\n",

       "  (Document(text='\\nEllen ‘t Hoen\\nThe writer is director of research group Medicines Law & Policy\\nDiscussions now taking place at the World Health Organization seek to reach consensus on a new pandemic agreement. The intention is to learn from mistakes made during Covid-19 to better prepare for the future. Unfortunately, a key intellectual property problem remains unaddressed, threatening to limit the scope of what the agreement can achieve in assuring timely and equitable access to pandemic countermeasures.\\nPharmaceutical products such as medicines, vaccines and diagnostics can be protected by several types of intellectual property, including patents and trade secrets. Although a basic description of how to manufacture a product may exist in published patent documents, its manufacture at scale often requires access to associated trade secrets developed by the patent owner. This is especially true of complex products such as monoclonal antibodies or mRNA vaccines.\\nA future pandemic may well require the urgent manufacture of a complex pharmaceutical product on a very large scale, one beyond the capability of the intellectual property owner alone. Third parties would accordingly require access to both patents and associated trade secrets. The owner could enter into voluntary agreements granting patent licences and sharing these with others. However, Covid-19 demonstrated that, even during a global emergency, some intellectual property owners were unwilling or unable to do so. Given this, having an alternative mechanism is vital.\\nPatents are public instruments granted by national or regional authorities. During a pandemic, each country can decide for itself how to deal with them. The current draft agreement includes measures such as compulsory patent licences or pandemic-related patent waivers. By contrast, trade secrets are by their very nature not disclosed to the public and are likely to be located in a limited set of countries, for example, those in which the product is manufactured. Even during a pandemic, these countries cannot be required to compel the sharing of trade secrets.\\nThe current draft does not address this and is thus essentially limited to enabling the manufacture of comparatively simple pharmaceutical products, which generally do not require access to information that is not publicly available. To extend its scope, countries must consider an additional measure that can compel the sharing of trade secrets in a pandemic emergency. Such a measure would be in the interest of high-income countries (HICs) just as much as low- and middle- income ones (LMICs).\\nThe European\\xa0Commission provided evidence of this in its recently proposed regulation for\\xa0EU-wide compulsory patent licensing in an emergency. This envisages imposing a duty on patent owners to collaborate with licensees, including access to associated indispensable information which is kept secret,\\xa0to ensure that production is effective and efficient. Given the democratisation of technologies such as synthetic biology and machine learning, it is likely that future pandemic countermeasures and associated trade secrets could be developed in present-day LMICs. Third-party manufacturers in HICs could then be the ones seeking such sharing.\\nWe therefore propose a new measure requiring countries to compel intellectual property owners to share trade secrets when determined necessary in a pandemic emergency. It is based on powers already used in HICs in the context of antitrust law and national emergencies. Such powers are compatible with the World Trade Organization agreement, which only requires that trade secrets be protected against unfair competition.\\nThe current WHO discussions represent a desperately needed opportunity to better prepare for the future. They must deliver a set of international rules robustly adequate to the task.\\nChristopher Garrison contributed to this article', metadata={'query': 'Legal considerations surrounding password sharing', 'datasource': 'FinancialTimesData', 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/c76d6f5a-0d82-493c-8d8a-5cdf8cf4a1d4', 'title': 'Sharing trade secrets is key to the pandemic agreements', 'publication_time': '2023-09-25T16:27:36.565Z'}, uuid=UUID('6b273875-a3f7-4769-9134-48064131bf8c'), db_id=''),\n",

It added: “We make crystal clear to every employee through our extensive compliance and training procedures that we have absolutely zero tolerance for the behaviour alleged, and we are fully co-operating with the authorities.”\\n“The allegations in the indictment are egregious,” said Goldman Sachs in a statement. “The firm has zero tolerance for this kind of behavior, which violates our standard of conduct and our business principles. We continue to fully co-operate with the government on this matter.”\\nA lawyer for Viggiano said he would “vigorously defend” his client against the charges, while a lawyer for Forlano said his client “denies trading on insider information and will vigorously contest these allegations in the appropriate forum — court.”\\nA lawyer for Salamone declined to comment.\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission also sued Viggiano, Forlano, Salamone, and a fourth individual, Nathan Bleckley, for allegedly trading on unlawfully disclosed information.\\nThe agency’s complaint details how Viggiano allegedly tipped Forlano in 2021 about the looming AIG deal, in which the insurer sold a 9.9 per cent stake in its life and retirement business to Blackstone for $2.2bn and announced a broader investment management partnership with the private equity firm. AIG’s shares rose by more than 3.5 per cent following the public announcement of the deal.\\nForlano in turn shared the information with Bleckley in the SEC’s case, the complaint alleged, who messaged to say he had not bought in “Bc my funds are low.”\\xa0A lawyer for Bleckley said his client was “a dedicated member of the armed forces” who “places a high priority on doing what’s right”.\\nWhen Forlano replied that “Rigatoni” — a nickname for Viggiano — “literally works for” Blackstone, Bleckley responded “F[**]k u should’ve told me f[**]k the feds.” Forlano then allegedly sent a text message saying: “next one i got you’ll be the first to know”, according to the court documents.\\nIn the criminal indictment, prosecutors alleged that Viggiano and Forlano had attempted to avoid detection by using encrypted messaging applications such as Signal and the XBox 360 communication platform.

      "Netflix's new policy on password sharing appears to be good for its business based on the story provided. The enforcement of fees for additional households is a strategic move to convert freeloaders—an estimated 100 million households benefiting from shared accounts—into paying customers. This policy has already shown positive results by attracting nearly 6 million new subscribers within just a quarter, indicating a successful shift in user behavior towards a more monetized model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the introduction of an ad-supported streaming option aligns with current consumer trends, enhancing Netflix’s ability to cater to price-sensitive users while increasing engagement metrics, which are important for investors. The reported 54 percent surge in operating income amid rising subscriber numbers further substantiates the effectiveness of this strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while there may have been initial backlash, the resulting increase in subscribers and revenue forecast suggest that the new password-sharing policy positions Netflix favorably in an increasingly competitive market, thereby having a positive impact on its business.\n"
