    "The challenge I am trying to overcome can be summarized by this paragraph from the paper \"Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence in GPT-4\":\n",
    "> One possible way to interpret these limitations is to draw an analogy between the model and the concepts of fast and slow thinking, as proposed by Kahneman in [Kah11]. Fast thinking is a mode of thinking that is automatic, intuitive, and effortless, but also prone to errors and biases. Slow thinking is a mode of thinking that is controlled, rational, and effortful, but also more accurate and reliable. Kahneman argues that human cognition is a mixture of these two modes of thinking, and that we often rely on fast thinking when we should use slow thinking, or vice versa. The model can be seen as able to perform “fast thinking” operations to a very impressive extent, but is missing the “slow thinking” component which oversees the thought process, uses the fast-thinking component as a subroutine together with working memory and an organized thinking scheme. We note that a similar argument was made by LeCun in [LeC22], where a different architecture is proposed to overcome these limitations."

      "[Semiconductor Industry Strategist] As a Semiconductor Industry Strategist, I hypothesize that Deepseek’s ultra-low-cost reasoning model will initially stimulate greater AI adoption and experimentation, paradoxically increasing near-term demand for NVIDIA’s GPUs as more enterprises scale LLM use-cases, but could ultimately erode NVIDIA’s pricing power and long-term margin expansion if subsequent model efficiency breakthroughs reduce overall compute intensity required per inference.\n",
      "[Semiconductor Industry Strategist] As a Semiconductor Industry Strategist, Deepseek’s low-cost, high-efficiency reasoning model will likely accelerate the market shift towards compute-optimized, inference-heavy deployments, incentivizing hyperscalers and AI startups to prioritize hardware efficiency over brute-force GPU expansion, which could moderate NVIDIA’s future datacenter GPU demand growth but boost long-term demand for specialized inference accelerators, software-hardware co-design, and ecosystem partnerships—potentially impacting NVIDIA’s valuation more by shifting revenue composition than reducing absolute firm performance.\n",
      "[Semiconductor Industry Strategist] As a Semiconductor Industry Strategist, I hypothesize that Deepseek's ultra-low-cost reasoning model will paradoxically boost demand for NVIDIA's GPUs in the short-to-medium term, as it democratizes access to advanced AI—expanding the total addressable market for inference workloads on existing GPU infrastructure—before any longer-term hardware disintermediation risk materializes.\n",
      "[AI Market Economist] As a AI Market Economist, I hypothesize that Deepseek's ultra-low-cost reasoning model will intensify demand for AI infrastructure among smaller and cost-sensitive firms, paradoxically boosting NVIDIA's revenue streams in the short-to-medium term by democratizing access and driving aggregate compute consumption, even if it pressures cloud titans’ margins and threatens NVIDIA’s longer-term pricing power as AI commoditizes.\n",
      "[AI Market Economist] As a AI Market Economist, Deepseek's ultra-low-cost reasoning model—if widely adopted—will likely accelerate demand for inference at the network edge and in cost-sensitive sectors, causing a subtle but significant pivot in NVIDIA's revenue mix toward lower-margin hardware, which may temper its premium valuation even as overall AI hardware shipments rise.\n",
      "[AI Market Economist] As an AI Market Economist, I hypothesize that Deepseek's radically cheaper reasoning model will accelerate industry-wide commoditization of large language models, ultimately prompting hyperscalers and AI startups to seek cost-saving custom silicon solutions, thereby catalyzing a gradual erosion of NVIDIA’s AI margin premiums—even before headline financial metrics reflect major sales declines—resulting in heightened market sensitivity and potentially downward pressure on NVIDIA’s valuation.\n",
      "[Cloud Infrastructure Procurement Officer] As a Cloud Infrastructure Procurement Officer, I hypothesize that Deepseek’s new, much cheaper reasoning model will drive hyperscale clients to demand less frequent refresh cycles and smaller quantities of NVIDIA’s premium GPUs, which—by elongating hardware replacement timelines—could slow NVIDIA’s revenue growth and introduce valuation uncertainty, as cloud providers pivot toward maximizing returns on existing infrastructure over speculative new GPU purchases.\n",
      "[Cloud Infrastructure Procurement Officer] As a Cloud Infrastructure Procurement Officer, I hypothesize that Deepseek’s ultra-low-cost reasoning model will prompt major cloud clients to shift AI workloads to more compute- and cost-efficient clusters—potentially reducing demand for the latest, highest-margin NVIDIA accelerators—thereby pressuring NVIDIA’s near-term revenue growth and compelling them to diversify hardware offerings for models optimized for efficiency over raw power, factors likely to moderate valuations premised on unrelenting demand for top-tier GPUs.\n",
      "[Cloud Infrastructure Procurement Officer] As a Cloud Infrastructure Procurement Officer, I hypothesize that Deepseek’s 10x cheaper reasoning model will drive major clients to demand increased procurement of non-NVIDIA hardware optimized for cost-efficient inference, pressuring NVIDIA's margin dominance in AI accelerators and potentially dampening its valuation growth as hyperscalers diversify hardware vendors in response to lower model costs.\n",

      "1. Analyze Deepseek’s new model: Outline its key features (cost, efficiency, performance) and how it compares to models like GPT-4.\n",
      "2. Evaluate immediate AI ecosystem effects: Project how an ultra-low-cost, capable model could impact overall AI adoption and compute consumption.\n",
      "3. Assess short-term impact on NVIDIA: Consider NVIDIA’s current business model, customer base, and demand elasticity for its products.\n",
      "4. Explore long-term disruption risks: Analyze how sustained advances in model efficiency could alter the economics of AI and NVIDIA’s competitive moats—especially if compute requirements fall.\n",
      "5. Synthesize into a narrative: Connect these developments to NVIDIA’s valuation story, integrating potential feedback loops and paradoxes.\n",
      "6. Conclude with a working hypothesis that tells a compelling, story-driven answer to the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "Deepseek’s new reasoning model—promising intelligence at nearly one-tenth the inference cost of GPT-4—marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of generative AI economics. This advance lowers the financial and technical barriers to deploying advanced language models, inviting a new wave of global enterprises, startups, and even niche players to experiment with and scale large language model (LLM) applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the immediate aftermath, this democratization of high-powered AI is a boon for NVIDIA. As more organizations flock to test, fine-tune, and deploy Deepseek’s model, aggregate computational demand is likely to surge, driving continued sales of NVIDIA’s GPU accelerators. The enthusiasm to “do more with less” paradoxically causes a gold rush for compute resources—especially as creative AI applications explode across industries previously priced out of the LLM market.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, beyond the swell of initial demand, Deepseek’s cost-efficient approach threatens to rewrite the rules of the game. If subsequent breakthroughs continue to cut model inference intensity, enterprises may ultimately require fewer or less-expensive GPUs to achieve the same—or greater—business value. At the extreme, innovation in algorithmic efficiency could commoditize AI compute, squeezing NVIDIA’s premium pricing and long-term margins, particularly if alternative hardware architectures or competing chipmakers catch up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, Deepseek’s ultra-low-cost model may serve as both a catalyst for NVIDIA’s near-term growth and the spark for a strategic inflection point: NVIDIA’s fortress-like GPU business will thrive as enterprises rush to harness cheap, capable AI, but sustained efficiency advances could gradually erode the pricing power and margin expansion underpinning its current sky-high valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Working Narrative Hypothesis:  \n",
      "Deepseek’s low-cost reasoning model will ignite an unprecedented flurry of AI adoption, temporarily amplifying demand for NVIDIA’s GPUs as enterprises scale out new use-cases and flood the market with AI experimentation. Yet, this initial boom will set the stage for a more competitive, efficiency-driven AI era, in which NVIDIA’s dominant position and pricing leverage face mounting long-term risk from the very innovation it enabled—compelling the company to reinvent itself, lest it become a victim of generative AI’s own relentless progress.\n"

      "Observation 1: Deepseek released Deepseek-VL, a large language vision model, in April 2024. The company claims Deepseek-VL presents near-SOTA (state-of-the-art) results in VQA (Visual Question Answering), OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and Visual Reasoning benchmarks. The model introduces a two-stage pretraining approach and a visual expert module for efficient multi-modal LLM training. Early user feedback indicates high efficiency in practical tasks, and the model has seen adoption in several Chinese AI startups and research projects due to its open weights and performance-cost tradeoff.\n",

      "Observation 2: In June 2024, multiple financial analysts (including from Morgan Stanley and Citi) noted that demand for NVIDIA’s H100 and newer AI GPUs remains robust as AI companies and cloud providers ramp up LLM training and inference. However, there is growing industry discussion about long-term cost efficiency as model providers seek to lower the cost per token and experiment with more efficient architectures and quantization methods. Several commentators say that downward pressure on inference costs could alter the pace of GPU procurement later in 2024, but near-term demand remains strong due to continued LLM scaling and a backlog of orders. Additionally, some startups are choosing alternative chips or methods for model compression and efficiency to optimize cost, but NVIDIA’s ecosystem and software support remain dominant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thought: Recent commentary suggests that while there is pressure on AI model providers to reduce operational costs (which could eventually slow demand), NVIDIA’s GPU demand is currently still strong due to scaling of LLMs and a backlog, though efficiencies and alternative approaches are being closely monitored by the market.\n",

      "Observation 3: In a May 2024 interview, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged that improvements in AI model efficiency (like quantization, pruning, and architectural advances) could increase “effective compute” but argued that increasing model size and continued innovation would offset this, driving ongoing demand for advanced GPUs. Industry analysts agree that cost structure changes may shift some demand toward lower-end or specialized chips, but expect high demand for premium NVIDIA GPUs throughout 2024, especially for models that push boundaries of size and capability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thought: This provides a direct statement from NVIDIA leadership and analysts on the relationship between AI efficiency improvements and GPU demand—it’s anticipated that efficiency gains may slightly moderate hardware demand, but not overhaul it, due to continued model scaling and innovation.\n",

Early adoption is seen among Chinese AI startups and research projects, attracted by the model’s open weights, efficiency, and favorable performance-cost tradeoff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding NVIDIA GPU demand: As of mid-2024, NVIDIA’s H100 and successor GPUs remain in high demand, driven by the scaling and deployment of large language models. Although there is industry focus on improving AI cost structure (via quantization, model pruning, and more efficient architectures), this has so far not significantly reduced GPU demand. Commentary from NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and industry analysts suggests that efficiency gains may increase “effective compute,” but ongoing model scaling and innovation are expected to sustain strong demand for NVIDIA’s GPUs at least through 2024. Some startups are exploring alternative chips and model optimizations for cost reasons, but the NVIDIA ecosystem remains dominant.\n",
