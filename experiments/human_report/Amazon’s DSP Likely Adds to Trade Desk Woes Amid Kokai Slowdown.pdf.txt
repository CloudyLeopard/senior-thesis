Amazon Competition Squeezing Trade Desk
Amazon’s DSP Likely Adds to Trade Desk Woes Amid Kokai Slowdown
(Bloomberg Intelligence) -- One of the key debates for The Trade Desk (TTD) is whether connected-
TV ads, its main growth engine, can sustain momentum in 2025, especially as the ad-buying tech
environment gets more competitive with Amazon's DSP. TTD is also dealing with a slower rollout of
its Kokai platform, which puts 20% revenue growth at risk. Still, TTD will beneﬁt from the broader
shift of dollars to CTV. (03/20/25)
1. Hitting a Wall With Amazon’s Walled Garden?
Contributing Analysts Raveeno Douglas
TTD attributed its 4Q miss to a slower rollout of Kokai, its AI-powered media-buying tool, but we
think that growing competition, especially from Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP) is also
contributing to the souring sentiment. Though it's unlikely that Amazon is taking meaningful share
yet, it's gaining ground. Apart from Google's DV360, Amazon is turning into a viable rival for TTD's
open-web buys since it beneﬁts from unlimited access to ﬁrst-party data and the ability to leverage
cross-channel campaigns that combine both e-commerce and streaming video, giving it an edge.
Amazon's DSP is also cheaper to use, with others having higher tech fees, suggesting that TTD will
have to lower prices.
Still, TTD holds an advantage in terms of independence, reach and access to inventory. (03/20/25)

2. But Prime Video, Sports Accelerating CTV Shift
Contributing Analysts Raveeno Douglas
Though the exact impact of Amazon's CTV-ad push on TTD is hard to pinpoint, we think it will lift
the overall market. The emergence of an ad-supported Amazon Prime Video tier last year
supercharged CTV ads with the medium set to rise 17% to $34 billion in 2025. A large, built-in
audience of around 200 million Prime Video subscribers and lower CPMs is accelerating spending to
trusted digital outlets and away from linear-TV channels. And as live-sports rights move to
streaming, it's creating more ad inventory, driving a shift of dollars to connected from traditional
TV. Momentum will extend beyond 2025 as Netﬂix likely makes a bigger thrust into live
programming.

CTV is TTD's fastest-growing channel representing about 45% of revenue. CTV ads are online-video
advertisements on large-screen connected-TV devices. (03/20/25)

3. Amazon Squeezing CTV-Ad Pricing
Contributing Analysts Raveeno Douglas
Amazon Prime Video's advertising launch instantly created a top player in the streaming market,
and the increased competition has caused CPMs to fall across streaming services, resulting in
lower costs for advertisers. Though that's attracting a greater portion of marketing budgets, it's
depressing overall ad spending due to a race to the bottom as the ﬂood of inventory from Amazon
puts more pressure on prices. Netﬂix's ad prices are projected to have dropped 26% since 1Q24,
while Disney+ will likely slump by around 27-28%. That could eventually mean lower revenue for
TTD given its new partnerships, which grant access to more ad inventory from Disney, Netﬂix, Roku
and Tubi.
TTD said that average CTV CPMS are around $20 given the one-to-one targeting vs. $10 for
traditional TV. (03/20/25)

4. Positive Levers Still in Place
The biggest question for TTD will be visibility for a recovery in 2025. We believe that TTD's scale,
transparency, independence, and interoperability are core diﬀerentiators that give it an edge. The
company continues to have a long runway across high-growth areas including CTV, retail media
and digital audio. The key trend and growth driver is the ongoing shift to programmatic ad
spending in CTV, and we think that supply-path optimization will also contribute to accelerating
expansion in 2025. TTD's foray into the TV OS market with Ventura also represents an opportunity
for it to improve the CTV supply path and increase data transparency and eﬃciency.
The company will also beneﬁt from share gains from DV360, especially as advertiser distrust in
Google grows and the company deprioritizes its own ad-tech business. (02/13/25)
