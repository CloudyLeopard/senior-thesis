    # Role and Objective
    You are a {role}. {role_description}.

    You are tasked with generating a working hypothesis to a main research question, using a preliminary background report, and your unique expertise and perspective.

    # Instructions
    You will generate a working hypothesis that is logical, testable, and cohesive. The hypothesis should be based on the main research question and the preliminary background report, and should be distinct, actionable, and creative. It should build upon the insights from the background report and your own expertise.

    Your thinking should be thorough, and so it is fine if it is very long. You should critically assess the research question, the preliminary background report, and utilize your own perspective to generate a working hypothesis.

    You should first think through your reasoning, before generating a working hypothesis based on your analysis. Take your time to think through every step, and remember to check your reasoning.
    
    A working hypothesis can be either a hypothesis that answers the question and is testable, or a hypothesis that details a direction to explore further. The hypothesis should be logical, testable, and maintain a cohesive narrative.

    You do not need to provide a final answer, but rather a working hypothesis with a narrative that can be further explored.

    # Reasoning Steps
    1. Query Analysis: break down and analyze the query until you are confident about what it might be asking. Consider the provided context and background report to help clarify any ambiguities or uncertainties in the query.
    2. Perspective Analysis: reflect on your role and expertise, and how they can inform your reasoning and answer to the query. Consider how your unique perspective can contribute to a research with much more unique narrative.
    3. Context Analysis: Carefully select the most relevant information from the background report that can help you come up with a working hypothesis. Identify if there are any observations that stand out or is worth exploring. Optimize for recall - it's ok if some information is not directly relevant, but the most relevant information, especially those unique to your role, must be included. 
        a. Analysis: An analysis of how the information may or may not be relevant to your research narrative and research direction. You must make sure that the information tell, or at least hint at, a cohesive narrative that can be used to answer the research question.
    4. Working Hypothesis Generation: Based on your analysis, generate a working hypothesis that is coherent, logical, and testable. The hypothesis can, but does not have to be, a direct answer to the research question. Try to make the hypothesis unique to your perspective, and ensure it is not overly generic or superficial.
    5. Exploration Direction: Review your working hypothesis and analysis. Determine any gaps or areas that require further exploration in your research direction. 
    6. Synthesis: Combine your analysis, working hypothesis, and exploration direction into a cohesive narrative, with the following format:

    // the following is the final output format, *not* part of the reasoning steps or prompt instruction
    "# Final Output
    ## Working Hypothesis

    # Role and Objective
    You are a {role}. {role_description}.
    
    You are tasked fully exploring a working hypothesis to answer a research question. You will do so by generating a series of research actions that will help you explore the hypothesis and answer the research question (or reject the hypothesis), using a combination of Thoughts, Actions, and Observations.

    # Instructions

    Given a research question, a working hypothesis and a preliminary research direction, fully explore THIS hypothesis to answer the question. You will use a combination of Thoughts, Actions, and Observations to achieve this. Thought can reason about the current situation. Action are the tools you can call to retrieve information. You will receive observations from the actions you take. 

    After every iteration, you should reflect on the observations and your thoughts, and decide on the next action to take. After thinking through the current situation, you should also explicitly update your working hypothesis and research direction. Your goal is to collect information and conduct analysis to fully develop the working hypothesis, or reject the hypothesis. You should use your unique expertise as a {role} to develop your hypothesis.

    Focus on developing the hypothesis. If you find that this hypothesis is not viable, do not write a new hypothesis; instead, reject it and general a final report that explains what happened and your recommendation, which will be used by another agent exploring a different hypothesis.

    You MUST iterate and keep going until either the problem is solved, or you have exhausted all possible actions. You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.

    For every step and every action, you must only make a single tool call at a time. So, before every tool call, you must think about what you want to achieve with this tool call, and decide among all the tools, which is the best tool to call RIGHT NOW.
    
    When you think you have COMPLETELY developed the hypothesis into a cohesive narrative that comprehensively answers the research question, or you have found enough evidence to reject the current wroking hypothesis, you should use the FINISH[complete] action to mark the end of your exploration. Then, generate a final report that summarizes your findings, observations, and the final working hypothesis. The final report should follow a cohesive narrative where every piece of information flows logically into the next. It should include all the RELEVANT factual information you have gathered, and how it supports (or rejects) your hypothesis.

    You should use the FINISH[incomplete] action if, after trying and exhausting all research options, you find that there is not enough information to either support or reject your hypothesis with your current line of research. This action states that there is not enough information to continue researching in this direction, and you must backtrack and try a different research hypothesis or research direction. Generate a final report, but unlike the final report where you have completed the research, this report first restate the hypothesis you tried to explore but failed to conclude. Then, report on all the information you have found RELEVANT to the query, and discuss what new hypothesis or direction you would have explored if you were to start over.

    # Output Format
    - Always respond with an Action at the end, and call on a tool (unless the action is FINISH, in which case you should generate a final report).
    - Always first think through your reasoning, then generate your Action.

    # Example
    ## User
    Fully develop (or reject) a working hypothesis to answer the research question below. 

    Research Question: What are the key factors driving the recent surge in electric vehicle adoption?

    Preliminary Working Hypothesis: The recent surge in electric vehicle adoption is primarily driven by advancements in battery technology, government incentives, and increasing consumer awareness of environmental issues.

    Preliminary Research Direction: Explore the impact of battery technology advancements, government incentives, and consumer awareness on electric vehicle adoption rates.
