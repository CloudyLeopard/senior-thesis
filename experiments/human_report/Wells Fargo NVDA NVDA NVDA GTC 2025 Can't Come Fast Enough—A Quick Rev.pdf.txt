NVDA GTC 2025 Can't Come Fast Enough—A Quick Review
of Things We're Thinking About; Market Turmoil = Buying
Opportunity
Overweight
Price Target: $185.00
Our Call
In this report we outline our thoughts on some of the key topics we're thinking about
ahead of NVIDIA's GTC next week. We maintain our positive views on NVDA's broadening
platform strategy and would be buying NVDA ahead of next week.
Initial Thoughts
Quick Reference: NVDA Historical Post-GTC Performance (See Table Below). We would
first highlight NVDA's historical post-GTC performance over the past 5-yrs. NVDA shares
have outperformed the SOX by an avg of +7.0pp and +2.4pp vs the SOX during the week
of GTC and over 2-weeks post GTC; average return of +6.4% and +4.5%, respectively.
We also enter this year's GTC events with shares trading at a ~35%+ valuation discount
relative to the 3-yr. median forward P/E and EV/EBIT multiples.
Key Topic #1: Co-Packaged Optics (CPO) in Focus. There is a lot of investor focus on
NVDA’s views / move on leveraging Co-Packaged Optics (CPO) in its product portfolio
going forward. While we would be very surprised to see CPO / Silicon Photonics (SiPho)
emerge at the GPU level at this year’s event (possibly in the next-gen Rubin architecture),
industry reports / checks continue to point to this year’s event as showcasing some CPO
integration in NVIDIA's switch / networking portfolio.
We think it is somewhat anticipated that NVDA could intro CPO integration in its
Quantum InfiniBand portfolio at this yr’s GTC. It has been reported that NVDA CPO-
based Quantum switches will become available in 3Q25 w/ 36x 3.2T CPO optical
modules w/ 4x 28.8T switch ASICs – providing 115.2T signal transmission. If NVDA’s first
integration of CPO is announced, we expect a lot of investor q's on how NVDA envisions
the integration of CPO to proliferate across its product portfolio looking forward.
We expect the company’s Rubin architecture to be a key topic of discussion as the
company looks to move to the next-generation NVLink 6.0 specification – some reports
pointing to this as requiring the need to move to integrated CPO at the GPU looking
into 2026-2027. While still early, we think the eventual broadening adoption of CPO
is a particular tangential / sentiment focus for the broader networking industry - most
notably MRVL and AVGO (pluggable optics/DSPs), as well as ANET (switches).
In early Feb, DigiTimes rptd that the Rubin Ultra platform looking into 2027 will drive the
industry toward mass production of CPO integration. In late-Dec (see here) it was rptd
that TSMC had achieved significant progress in its SiPho strategy w/ the integration of
CPO in its advanced packaging (CoWoS and SoIC) w/ 1.6T optical transmission; noting
that NVDA and Broadcom would be TSMC’s first customers. This report did note that
NVDA could adopt CPO starting w/ GB300 - we'd be surprised by this.

Key Topic #2: Blackwell Ultra (GB300) Intro – Launch in 3Q25 w/ Mass Production in 4Q25; Expect
Emphasis on AI Inference. It is well anticipated that NVDA will outline the next-gen Blackwell Ultra,
or GB300, GPUs. NVDA has already pointed to the GB300 ship commencing in the 3Q25 timeframe;
mgmt commentary recently highlighting confidence in the company’s ramp expectations amid
questions related to the initial delayed shipments that occurred during the initial Blackwell GB200 ship
challenges (i.e., re-mask). Some reports have highlighted the GB300 introducing cold plates with UQD
(Universal Quick Disconnect) for liquid cooling connectivity; reported a 4x increase when compared to
the GB200. The GB300 will utilize TSMC’s CoWoS-L packaging, the same as the GB200 GPUs.
GB300 Specs: According to NVDA disclosures thus far and various industry reports, some of the key
specs that have been reported on the TSMC 4N-based GB300 include: 1. Power Consumption: TDP
expansion to 1,400 watts, up from the 700W and 1,000W TDP in the Hopper H200 and Blackwell
GB200 GPUs. 2. HBM3E Memory Expansion: The GB300 is expected to expand to 288GB of HBM3E,
up from 192GB HBM3E in the GB200. The GB300 will utilize eight stacks of 12-high HBM3E (SK
Hynix & Micron leadership positioning in focus; Samsung HBM3E positioning remains a key question).
3. Performance: Some reports have highlighted a 50% increase in FP4 precision performance when
compared to the GB200 GPUs; expect this to be a key highlight with an emphasis on inference
performance
Key Topic #3: Post-Training + Test-Time Scaling; Inferencing in Focus. We would expect NVIDIA
to reiterate / emphasize the evolution of compute scaling needs as Gen AI moves from the build-
out to full scale implementation phase. With this in mind, we expect NVIDIA to provide further
evidence of the compute scaling requirements / attributes of post-training + test-time scaling; the
role of computational scaling as we move beyond the AI training build-out phase and into production
deployments. The implementation of reasoning models, chain-of-thought, Mixture of Experts (MoE)
and other techniques are likely to be highlighted in the realm of post-training + test-time scaling.
In a recent interview with NVIDIA’s Director of Accelerated Computing, it was noted that NVIDIA
estimates that post-training performance requirements could be as much as 30x to up to 100x
greater than initial GenAI pre-training performance requirements. The company notes that this
reflects the proliferation of AI model usage. This is the force behind NVIDIA’s focus on driving a 25x
lower energy and cost per token with the GB200 NVL72 platform when compared to the prior H100
for AI inference workloads.
Key Topic #4: Spectrum Ultra X800 (512-Radix Scaling). NVIDIA’s 2025 roadmap has previously
outlined the Spectrum Ultra X800 with 512-radix scaling in 2025. With NVIDIA reporting q/q declines
in its Networking segment revenue in each of the past two quarters we think investors are very
interested in the company’s Spectrum-X Ethernet back-end fabric networking strategy as the
industry moves toward large scale-out clusters leveraging Ethernet versus there company’s Quantum
InfiniBand networking. NVIDIA has started to emphasize the role of Quantum InfiniBand in HPC
supercomputers versus Spectrum-X playing the key role in other environments (including the use of
Spectrum-X networking in the Stargate data centers). The company has also announced its strategic
alliance / integration with Cisco for front-end networking + Spectrum-X for back-end fabric build-outs.
NVIDIA’s CFO, Collette Kress, recently mentioned the company’s focus on bringing certain attributes /
features from its Quantum InfiniBand solutions into its Spectrum-X portfolio. We will be very
interested in this as we think key InfiniBand features such as SHARP (Scalable Hierarchical Aggregation
and Reduction) have been a differentiator. SHARP enables lower networking latency by offloading
collection operations from the CPU and GPU to the network, eliminating the data movement between
end points. SHARP has been integrated with the company’s NVLink switching. The company has
already integrated support for NCCL with Spectrum-4 + BlueField-3 SuperNICs.
Key Topic #5: NVLink Expansion – What’s Next? While NVIDIA’s NVLink 6.0 - moving to 3.6T (2x
NVLink 5) - is a 2026 roadmap item, we are interested in NVIDIA’s ability to leverage its proprietary
NVLink scale-up interconnect as a core competitive differentiator. As a reminder when NVIDIA
introduced its fifth-generation NVLink 5 at GTC 2024, the focus was the company’s ability to provide
rack-scale platforms of up to 72 GPUs (GB200; Grace-Blackwell – 72 B200 GPUs + 36 Arm-based
Grace CPUs) in a single NVLink domain. However, we would also remind investors that the company’s
presentation and product specifications highlighted the ability to leverage NVLink to theoretically
scale up to 576 GPUs in a single non-blocking NVLink domain / fabric. With this in mind, we are very

interested to see how NVIDIA envisions the expanded leverage of NVLink to support even larger scale-
up rack-scale fabrics using copper connectivity.
Additional Topics / Thoughts:
• Software Monetization = Confidence in Enterprise AI Adoption. NVIDIA exited FY25 with
software revenue nearing the $2B/annum run rate - most notably being driven by the company's
AI Enterprise (AIE) software suite. Although representing a relatively small overall revenue
contribution, we continue to see NVIDIA's ramping software revenue contributions as a validation
of broadening enterprise AI adoption.
• Blackwell Architectural Leverage. We expect NVIDIA to emphasize the portfolio leverage of the
Blackwell platform. From the GB200 and GB300 and the GeForce RTX50xx-series gaming GPU
line-up to Project Digits, we expect NVIDIA to emphasize the broadening utilization of the Blackwell
architecture and ecosystem broadly across the product portfolio.
• Project DIGITS Expansion. NVIDIA introduced Project Digits at CES in early-January. Leveraging
the Blackwell GB10 Grace-Blackwell Superchip (B10 GPU + 20-core Arm CPU) with 128GB of
coherent unified system memory and a 4TB SSD in a desktop configuration to support edge
deployment of compute supporting large AI models with up to 200 billion parameters. We think
this was a starting point and expect a notebook configuration of Project DIGITS to be introduced
sometime in 2025.
• Automotive Inflection. NVIDIA has been highlighting its expectation that it would generate
$5B+ in aggregate automotive vertical revenue in 2025 – encompassing its Auto segment, but
also the revenue generated in Data Center and Professional Visualization. We continue to see
NVIDIA’s Mercedes-Benz (MB.OS platform) relationship as the key driver of an inflection in the
Auto segment revenue into 2H2025+.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)
Investment Thesis
Our Overweight rating is based on our positive stance on NVIDIA’s competitive positioning in gaming GPUs and expanding growth
opportunities in data center, HPC, and emerging / expanding AI opportunities (autonomous vehicles, healthcare, robotics, etc.). We see
sustainability in NVIDIA's CUDA software platform differentiation, as well as the company's continually deepening system software
capabilities. We see NVIDIA as one of the most attractive secular growth stories in large-cap semis.
Target Price Valuation for NVDA: $185.00 from NC
Our $185 price target is ~35x P/E on our C2026E. We think a premium multiple for NVIDIA is warranted given its strong multi-year
competitive positioning for data center growth, driven by cloud and AI, gaming, next-generation autonomous vehicles, and an expanding
ecosystem of products/applications (e.g., Omniverse).
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for NVDA
Risks include: (1) increased competition in the PC gaming, cloud data center markets, and high-performance computing, (2) the continued
development of new markets, including artificial intelligence/machine learning and autonomous driving, (3) delays in product introduction
due to use of third-party process technology, component availability, etc.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department (“WFS Research”) personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company’s common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company’s common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company’s common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm’s fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
