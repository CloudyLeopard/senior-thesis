Full stream ahead - reinstate Netflix at Buy with a $370 PO Reinstating Coverage: BUY | PO: 370.00 USD | Price: 299.27 USD Reinstating on Netflix at Buy with a $3 70 PO We are reinstating coverage of Netflix (NFLX) with a Buy rating and a 12-month price objective (PO) of $370 (+24% upside potential). We value the shares using 20.5x EV/EBITDA multiple to our CY24E EBITDA estimate, which is supported by our DCF. Our valuation accounts for Netflix’s leading position within the still burgeoning shift towards non-linear video viewing, a strong runway for subscriber growth outside of the US (particularly across developing markets), upside from the initial advertising video on demand (AVOD) offering as well as its ramping profitability and strengthening FCF profile. Our forecasts do not account for incremental revenue/subscribers from password sharing initiatives or expanded AVOD offerings. We view NFLX’s risk/reward favorably as our bull case upside is 2.0x the bear case of share losses/slowing growth. Still the streaming leader Netflix transformed the way entertainment is created, distributed and consumed. In our view, the company’s global scale, strong brand, and superior user experience position it to remain a leader as this transition continues to transpire globally. Despite slower sub growth, we believe efforts to improve monetization via a value-oriented ad tier and significant conversion of password sharers has the potential to drive operating/financial upside. Specifically, we estimate Basic AVOD could drive $719mn in ’24 UCAN (United States/Canada) revenue. An extension of AVOD to Standard and Premium tiers could drive an incremental $627mn in UCAN revenue while password sharing could drive $863mn in UCAN revenue (both of which are not contemplated in our est.). From ‘21A- ‘24E we forecast a 9% rev. CAGR and a 10% EBITDA CAGR with subs growing from 223mn currently to an estimated 257mn. We project healthy FCF/share growth to $9.17 in ‘24E from -$0.35 in ‘21A. Netflix’s entry into AVOD (ad)ds value While there are legitimate shorter-term concerns (inventory glut, competition, softening macro backdrop), we believe that Netflix’s AVOD offering will be accretive due to: (1) the company’s ability to drive engagement; (2) extraordinary advertiser demand for its inventory due to Netflix’s ability to reach younger demos and offer exposure to cord- cutters and cord-nevers; (3) likelihood of receiving premium CPMs; and (4) potential to drive incremental subscriber growth by expanding the long term total addressable market (TAM) with support from addressing password sharing.

Company Sector Entertainment Company Description Netflix is a global leader in the streaming market offering a best-in-class subscription and advertising video on demand service to more than 220mn subscribers in over 190 countries. Netflix allows its subscribers to stream its deep library of high quality, original and licensed content on any internet-connected device including TVs, PC, and mobile devices. Investment Rationale Supported by its world class brand, leading global subscriber base (>220mn) and position as a leading innovator, we believe Netflix is poised to outperform driven by four main catalysts: (1) a significant subscriber runway accelerated by the shift from linear to streaming, (2) the introduction of a value-oriented, ad-supported tier which expands TAM and monetization, (3) a crackdown on password sharing, and (4) an inflection point in free cash flow.

      "Pages:  Netflix, Inc. | 15 November 2022    3 Full stream ahead We are reinstating coverage of Netflix (NFLX) with a Buy rating and $370 PO. We view Netflix as an attractive pure-play with a significant runway for growth in the still expanding streaming video market. Supported by its world-class brand, leading global subscriber base and position as a leading innovator we believe Netflix looks poised to outperform driven by four main catalysts: 1) Still significant subscriber runway: Netflix should benefit from a return to steady subscriber growth as more normalized post-COVID subscriber trends take shape, and the company profits from the accelerating shift from linear to streaming (with significant penetration potential yet to be realized in developing markets), its new AVOD tier and a crackdown on password sharing. In our view, these dynamics offer ample runway to continue to grow subs, ARPU and profitability. We currently forecast CY22E subscribers of 228mn and project this to grow at a 5% CAGR through 2030, reaching 340mn subs. 2) Adflix – Netflix’s entry into AVOD provides ad(ded) value: Netflix’s introduction of a value-oriented, ad-supported tier provides significant potential operating and financial upside driven by: (1) Netflix’s ability to reach highly attractive and younger demos who have cut the cord or were never part of the linear pay-TV universe; (2) strong advertising demand, which will drive strong CPMs leading to purely incremental adv. revenue (w/AVOD also meeting if not exceeding existing SVOD ARPU); (3) targeting improvements, which will enable Netflix to capture portions of the vast pool of dollars currently garnered by digital adv. (notably, the company has hired key digital advertising talent -- a significant signal, in our view, of broader AVOD aspirations than those currently in place) and (4) a 20-30% expansion of the subscriber TAM and possible churn reductions. In our base case, we estimate that UCAN AVOD on only the Basic tier will drive 3.5mn in incremental subs by ’24 and $719mn in incremental revenue. However, we believe that Netflix’s initial Basic AVOD offering will expand to its Premium and Standard tiers, potentially driving 2.1mn additional subscribers by ’24 which could generate $627mn in revenue in the UCAN. 3) Getting a fair share – upside from password sharing: NFLX estimates 100mn potential subscribers, including 30mn in UCAN, are potentially lost as a result of password sharing. We view this current headwind as an enormous potential long-term opportunity, with sizable upside realized in 2023/2024. Given the strong level of engagement on NFLX’s service, we believe they are particularly well-positioned to convert a significant percentage of these lost subs (otherwise these viewers will be cut off). Assuming NFLX can convert approximately 2/3 of these households by ’24 via a combination of Basic/Basic + Ads/additional $2 per households, we believe this would equate to 2.4mn additional subscribers (as well as 16.8mn accounts paying an additional $2/month) and $863mn in additional annual revenue from UCAN alone. For the rest of the world, assuming Netflix can capture even just 25% of password sharers via $2/month, it would amount to another ~18mn households paying additional fees and $420mn in additional annual revenue, with upside potential. 4) Inflection point in free cash flow: After several years of debt and equity financed investing, NFLX turned FCF positive in 2020. With well over 200mn subscribers, NFLX is in a unique position of now being a positive cash flow generating streaming service (unlike other streaming services or tech companies which are subsidized by other business divisions). In this more uncertain macro environment, reaching this milestone amplifies Netflix’s first mover advantage relative to other traditional media companies. Going forward, Netflix has targeted stable cash content spending over the next few years, which should drive additional operating leverage and FCF growth.  We project that FCF will grow from $1bn in 2022 to $4.1bn in 2024. CR\n",
      "Pages:  4 Netflix, Inc. | 15 November 2022 Exhibit 1: NFLX bull/base/bear scenarios Bull case upside is 2.0x  bear case risk Bull Scenario ($475/s): Enhanced scale leads to healthier margins --> NFLX is able to overcome competitive pressure across the globe, gain meaningful penetration internationally and moderately grow subs in UCAN. Initiatives on password sharing and a broader AVOD offering to all tiers successfully expand the subbase, while high CPMs/engagement more than offset any SVOD cannabilization. They are able to leverage pricing power to drive a CY21-24E revenue growth CAGR of 12%. Significant content spend moderation/synergies and marketing/tech efficiencies lead to 190+ bps of margin expansion from '21A to '24E. Base Scenario ($370/s): CY21A-24E revenue CAGR of +9% and EBITDA CAGR of +10% --> NFLX continues to face competitive pressures across the globe, although the launch of their AVOD offering gives them access to incremental TAM helping them maintain current penetration levels in developed markets and grow penetration faster in developing markets. They are able to continue leveraging pricing power to drive a CY21-24E revenue growth CAGR of 9%. Content spend moderation/synergies and marketing/tech efficiencies lead to 65+ bps of margin expansion from CY21A to CY24E. Bear Scenario ($238/s): Competition limits growth and pricing power '--> Competitive pressures continue to mount resulting in muted penetration gains across the globe ex. APAC. In UCAN specifically, the company loses market share leading to lower penetration levels. AVOD and password sharing fail to drive meaningful incremental TAM. Share losses limit pricing power resulting in a CY21-24E revenue growth CAGR of 5%. The incremental costs associated with the ad-supported tier, paired with higher content spend to support international growth against a more competitive backdrop lead to ~400 bps of margin contraction from CY21A to CY24E. Sourc e: BofA Global Researc h BofA GLOBAL R ESEAR CH Exhibit 2: Netflix projected FWD year potential Our NFLX PO is $370/share Sourc e: BofA Global Research BofA GLOBAL R ESEAR CH Valuation, PO of $370 Netflix currently trades at a high 16.7x CY24E EV/EBITDA, 32.6x CY24E P/FCF and 21.1x CY24E P/E, representing 104%, 118% and 58% premiums to traditional media companies. In our view, the current valuation reflects Netflix’ positioning as a beneficiary of the decline in legacy media models, most notably pay-TV penetration (which in the UCAN is down to 54% from its peak of 87% in 2009 and in our view, serves as a precursor to what will likely happen internationally). We think the share shift of viewing from linear to streaming should provide tailwinds to Netflix for several years. While Netflix’s growth is now more muted compared to prior years, we estimate it will grow EBITDA at a CY19-24E CAGR of 26%, whereas traditional media companies are projected to grow 4% over a comparable time period. Netflix has also hit an inflection point in FCF generation, guiding to roughly $1bn in 2022 and accelerating thereafter.

      "Pages:  Netflix, Inc. | 15 November 2022    5 Shift from pay-tv to streaming enables premium valuation Domestically, the pay-tv industry is in a state of secular decline—we anticipate pay-tv subscribers will decline in the mid to high-single digits and ratings declines will be even more pronounced as consumers increasingly consume other forms of media over the next several years. Internationally, we believe many of the same challenges exist and will become more evident as new streaming platforms take a foothold in those markets. In our view, a continued shift from pay-tv viewing to streaming is inevitable, driven by a number of factors, including: (1) streaming content is available on demand (wherever and whenever consumers want), (2) streaming platforms have an opportunity to achieve more scale globally (by reaching consumers that are not only outside of the pay-tv ecosystem but also anywhere they happen to be – in or outside of their home), (3) SVOD services do not have commercial interruptions and AVOD services often have lower ad loads with better targeting, (4) streaming services are cheaper than pay-tv and allow consumers to be more selective in regard to the content/services they want and (5) media networks are increasingly prioritizing marquee content for their own respective streaming services relative to their broadcast/cable networks. As this transition occurs and the media landscape continues to fragment, NFLX appears increasingly valuable as one of the go-to services to consume premium video content given its vast scale with an offering that provides both breadth and depth. As such, given NFLX penetrates just 30% of estimated internet households today, we anticipate there will be a long runway of growth for the company with additional pricing power over time leading to a premium multiple placed on the business. PO derivation Our $370 price objective (PO) implies +24% potential upside and is derived by applying a 20.5x EV/EBITDA multiple to our CY24E EBITDA estimate. Our 20.5x EV/EBITDA multiple is supported by our DCF valuation which assumes an approximate 5% terminal growth rate and 11% WACC. As shown in Exhibit 4, the 20.5x multiple represents a premium to the market’s 11.0x multiple reflecting NFLX’s superior EBITDA growth (CY19A-24E CAGR of 26% vs. the market’s 7%), although a discount to historical peak levels of ~24x due to structurally lower growth expectations. Further, Exhibit 5 highlights NFLX’s significantly higher FCF growth (CY22E-24E CAGR of 99%) and EPS growth (CY19A-24E CAGR of 23%) relative to both media peers and the market. CR\n",

After pivoting from its original DVD-rental-by-mail business, it has become a global streaming juggernaut as the company benefited from visionary industry leadership and execution capabilities while it navigated and catalyzed an industry transformation (which had impressive ripple effects through both the television and film industry). This has enabled Netflix to amass over 223mn global subscribers and massively disrupt an industry dominated by large, well- established peers—leading to a 35%+ annualized return over a ten-year period from 2011-2021 and a significant valuation premium to Media and Entertainment peers. In 1H22, Netflix had been challenged by a perfect storm of events including: (1) con cerns over slowing subscriber growth, (2) increased competition, (3) an investor focus on profitability given market volatility and (4) broader questions surrounding NFLX’s content creation capabilities/efficiencies relative to well-established media peers. This has driven an almost 60% decline from their November 2021 peak to-date as investors began to question the total addressable market opportunity in streaming, overall unit economics, NFLX’s strategy to re-accelerate subscriber growth and the next key driver in NFLX’s growth strategy. With the release of pricing and other details related to their initial AVOD offering, more information on how the company plans to combat password sharing as well as a return to subscriber growth in 3Q and healthy 4Q subscriber guidance some of these concerns have been quelled, at least temporarily. After confirming plans to launch an ad-supported tier during its 2Q22 earnings call, Netflix quickly launched its initial AVOD offering on November 3rd. We believe this pivot provides several strategic benefits such as better utilizing its existing scale an d 1st  party data (advantages advertisers covet), potentially monetizing engagement of password sharing viewers, and expanding the long term TAM of subscribers (particularly CR\n",
      "Pages:  10 Netflix, Inc. | 15 November 2022 internationally). Netflix is approaching this shift deliberately and with restraint by only introducing it as a Basic tier option and we expect it will take time to scale and build-out an advertising infrastructure to fully realize the potential of AVOD offerings across all segments. However, initial advertiser demand for Netflix’s platform has been robust and the company has/will have all the required tools to be successful in this strategic pivot. Importantly, the company will benefit greatly from its ability to attract younger demos and reach viewers who have left or were never part of the linear TV ecosystem. While we believe that Netflix’s AVOD offering will be accretive to shareholder value (Netflix management has stated AVOD will be neutral to accretive “out of the gates”), we recognize there are still several questions near term that will likely take a number of quarters to answer: (1) will NFLX be able to sustainably re-accelerate subscriber growth given rising (and meaningful) competition, (2) will NFLX eventually open its AVOD offering to tiers other than its Basic plan to encourage a large enough number of users to “downgrade” while still being able to make the transition accretive to total ARPU and the bottom line (advertising has costs), (3) will the proliferation of several ad-supported services drive a glut of supply that keeps monetization/CPMs depressed near term (4) will macro conditions hamper advertising demand near term, (5) what will the incremental content costs be to acquire the advertising rights of their licensed content (Netflix has highlighted that only 5-10% of viewing comes from content they do not have the advertising rights for) and (6) will Netflix be able to generate greater ROI and efficiency with existing content spend. Ultimately, we believe these concerns will prove fleeting. The company’s impressive scale, iconic brand, tremendous engagement advantage vs. other streaming platforms, the continued shift towards non-linear viewing and opportunity to drive incremental subscriber growth internationally will drive strong financial growth and share price outperformance. Additionally, its broader AVOD offering to all tiers and password sharing initiatives should provide incremental subscriber and revenue growth, in our view. Putting it into numbers We project Netflix will reach 257mn subscribers by the end of CY24E with continued pricing power, driving CY24E revenue of $38bn which represents a CY21-24E CAGR of 9%. We also estimate Netflix will be able to drive continued operating leverage as content spending growth moderates (or stabilizes), which we believe will offset any incremental investments in growth initiatives yielding +67 bps of cumulative EBITDA margin expansion from CY21 to CY24E, representing a CY21-24E EBITDA CAGR of 10%.

NFLX subs will  grow from 228mn in CY22E to 257mn in CY24E Sourc e: BofA Global Research BofA GLOBAL R ESEAR CH Business regional breakdown Netflix primarily derives its revenue through its global subscription streaming service (99.5% of total CY21A revenue), although the company also still maintains a small and shrinking domestic DVD business (0.5% of total revenue). Their streaming service is segmented into four regions: UCAN, EMEA, LATAM, and APAC. Within their regional segments, UCAN contributed $13.0bn (43.7% of total CY21A revenue) from 75mn subscribers (56.6% penetration of broadband households), EMEA contributed $9.7bn (32.7% of total revenue) from 74mn subscribers (25.8% penetration), LATAM contributed $3.6bn (12.0% of total revenue) from 40mn subscribers (41.5% penetrated), and APAC contributed $3.3bn (11.0% of total revenue) from 33mn subscribers (5.8% penetrated). Sizing the advertising opportunity With the pace of traditional linear video subscriber losses accelerating, we believe there is a significant opportunity for ad-supported video services, such as Netflix, to provide an alternative medium for advertisers and over time, as targeting capabilities and its sales process improve, to potentially siphon advertising dollars away from social media/digital competitors that has been lost over the past decade.

      "Pages:  12 Netflix, Inc. | 15 November 2022 is priced at $6.99 in the US and on average a 20% to 40% discount to Basic without ads depending on the country. Additionally, the new tier will not include the ability to download programming, although this feature will become available later. In our view, notwithstanding Netflix’s exceptional time to market, this approach by the company represents a measured launch whereby the company significantly reduces subscriber/ARPU cannibalization concerns, while also limiting potential revenue upside – at least initially – due to the small base of subs receiving the offer. Netflix’s existing scale and technology prowess (even if not yet an established advertising name presently) make them likely winners at an industry level from this opportunity. In our view, the initial offering being limited to only the Basic tier likely limits significant potential “downgrades” to AVOD. Indeed, Netflix noted that switching amongst plans is limited and we believe this alleviates concerns that it will be challenging for Netflix to accretively execute on this transition. More specifically, we view it as highly unlikely that subscribers now attached to the company’s higher priced Standard and Premium tiers will shift to the significantly lower priced Basic AVOD offering. As such, the incremental advertising revenue required to offset ARPU losses will be limited to making up the $3 difference between the $9.99 Basic offering and the new $6.99 AVOD tier in the US. Microsoft partnership comes with A-zure guarantees To many industry observers, NFLX’s selection of Microsoft (MSFT) as an advertising partner appeared to be driven by more than MFST’s advertising prowess alone.  GOOGL and Comcast Corp (CMCSA) (who were reportedly in the running) are widely considered industry leaders in advertising technology, however, their competitive positioning in the video advertising market made for a likely untenable working relationship.  Meanwhile, MSFT reportedly offered a significant revenue guarantee to de-risk this transition for Netflix.  From MSFT’s perspective, they are likely utilizing this relationship as a loss leader in the hopes of winning a cloud relationship with Netflix (among the largest buyers in the world), where Netflix currently uses AWS as their primary vendor.  Given Netflix’s recent hires of Jeremi Gorman and Peter Naylor (both previously with SNAP), who are both well-regarded ad executives, Netflix appears to be in the process of building out their own advertising infrastructure.  Indeed, the recent spate of hires are largely from key digital advertising positions at main competitors. Therefore, we view the partnership with MSFT as a prudent short-term solution that provides longer term optionality. Netflix’s success can be attributed in large part to their technology capabilities, seamless user experience and premium viewing experience.  As a corollary to this, the poor viewing experience on linear television, particularly with ever increasing ad-loads, made conditions ripe for a disruptive platform like Netflix.  As the company pivots, we believe Netflix will try to replicate this premium viewer experience as it incorporates advertising on their platform.  This could drive a more deliberate approach to advertising sales and brand sponsorships to ensure ads are targeted and no particular brands over saturate the viewer experience. Is AVOD addition, subtraction, or substitution? The ultimate success of Netflix’s pivot toward advertising will be driven by two key variables: 1) on a per unit basis, is AVOD ARPU greater than or equal to SVOD ARPU and 2) in a more fragmented media landscape will the AVOD platform be able to attract sufficient scale/engagement? At this early stage, the demand for Netflix’s inventory appears to outweigh any concerns around scale/engagement as Netflix has highlighted that it has had to turn away advertisers as it does not have sufficient supply to meet demand. Like traditional media companies, there are several factors to consider for the breakeven math in this transition.  While traditional media needs to manage the balance of maintaining highly profitable linear revenue streams while growing out their streaming CR\n",
      "Pages:  Netflix, Inc. | 15 November 2022    13 platforms, Netflix will need to recoup lost subscription revenue from those who “downgrade” from their premium SVOD service. Netflix is utilizing an ad load of ~4-5 minutes/hour, utilizing 15-30 second spots, which is consistent with other emerging AVOD platforms as a way to enhance the consumer experience. This inventory scarcity paired with likely targeting/addressability capabilities should enable CPM premiums over time. Netflix is well positioned to acquire the requisite scale given their extensive subscriber base. At the outset, with its initial foray into AVOD, Netflix has limited the potential impact of both its scale and potential downgrades by only offering Basic with ads. As Netflix increases its capabilities, we anticipate the company will also expand the AVOD offering to its Standard and Premium tiers. When Netflix expands the advertising offering, the pace at which subscribers downgrade and the ultimate mix of SVOD vs. AVOD subscribers will become larger and more impactful. In looking at other streaming providers who also offer AVOD options, there is a wide disparity of adoption. At one end of the spectrum, 70% of Hulu’s subscriber base skews toward ad-supported, in large part likely due to Hulu beginning as an ad-supported streaming service. Newer AVOD platforms, such as HBO Max have a much lower mix (although there will be a major relaunch in CY2Q23 under Warner Bros. Discovery). We ultimately believe the uptake of NFLX’s AVOD service will be significant, but will occur gradually over time, especially as the availability and pricing of all streaming services increase. However, in an environment where consumers have multiple AVOD/SVOD subscriptions, we believe it is also critical that Netflix maintains their current engagement levels as this is the driver of monetization. As shown in Exhibits 11 and 12, Netflix’s current cumulative viewership dwarfs most competitors. We estimate Netflix subscribers’ (a subscriber is defined as a household, not an individual), on average, watch ~43 hours per month.

      "Pages:  14 Netflix, Inc. | 15 November 2022 increase of digital inventory coming to market (DIS+ will also be launching an ad- supported tier in December 2022) and the macro backdrop remains challenged, we believe Netflix will likely lean into private programmatic guaranteed deals (which command higher CPMs than open real-time bidding) while their supply is limited near- term to offset these CPM pressures.  Ultimately, we anticipate Netflix will garner CPMs like other premium services, such as HBO Max and Disney+. Exhibit 13: Industry Reported CPMS for Select Services Netflix is reportedly seeking industry leading CPMs Sourc e: BofA Global Research, Business Insider, Wall Street Journal Note: Netflix CPMs reflect industry reporting vs. our current expectations BofA GLOBAL R ESEAR CH The pivot to AVOD is  not free Another consideration for Netflix’s AVOD transition is the incremental rights they need to acquire on their licensed content to offer on their platform. We estimate the incremental step up could be ~20%, for the content in each specific geography the ad- supported tier is launched in. The company has indicated the AVOD tier will likely not carry as many titles as the SVOD tier, thereby reducing the funding (but also the desirability) required for the ad-supported tier. Further, according to the company, most of the viewing (engagement) is in content they already have the advertising rights to). Additionally, with their focus on originals and in-house production, we anticipate this mix shift will continue to skew in favor of originally produced content, over time, likely reducing the impact of these incremental costs in coming years.

We are currently forecasting the Basic + Ads will have ~3.2mn subs by the end of 2023, of which 1.75mn are incremental, driving incremental revenue of $281mn and growing to >$1bn in 2025.

The opportunity could be significantly larger if Netflix: (1) receives even higher CPMs (such as the $65 CPMs they are targeting now), (2) increases ad-lite subscribers (again either through mix or absolute basis) but with limited SVOD cannibalization, (3) increases engagement and/or (4) increases advertising minutes/hour. To drive incremental EBITDA, the ad-tier would need to drive sufficiently high advertising-only ARPU to offset the discount from the ad-free tier and the incremental costs (both content costs and operating expenses). However, we note that our assumptions are overly punitive and likely underestimate the actual incremental benefit because: (1) we are not attributing incremental value to international AVOD markets – although Netflix has stated these markets will be neutral to slightly positive on unit economics and (2) we have only modeled the Basic + Ads tier, whereas, it is our belief they will eventually launch a similar offering for the Standard and Premium tiers. Expanding the model to include an eventual launch of AVOD to Netflix’s Standard and Premium tiers will drive additional upside, in our view. As Exhibit 17 shows, we believe that by launching a more expansive AVOD offering in ’24, Netflix could drive, in UCAN alone, an incremental 3mn subscribers and as a result, drive an incremental >$1bn of revenue in addition to the Basic + Ads tier contribution by ‘25. CR\n",
      "Pages:  16 Netflix, Inc. | 15 November 2022 Within this build up, we assume: (1) Standard and Premium households are equally as likely to downgrade to their respective ad-supported tier than their Basic counterparts (note, Antenna data shows households are equally likely to downgrade to ad-supported regardless of income), (2) advertising ARPU remains the same across all ad-supported tiers given engagement and CPMs are unlikely to vary between tiers, and (3) Netflix prices the Standard and Premium ad-supported tiers $3 below their ad-free counterparts, similar to the Basic tier.

      "Pages:  Netflix, Inc. | 15 November 2022    17 The International Opportunity While total advertising spend in the US ($293bn in 2021) dwarfs any single market, the total spend across all international markets where Netflix is initially launching their AVOD offering ($230bn in 2021 ex. US) is significant. Similar to the trends within the US, digital video advertising – which includes in-stream video formats (YouTube, Hulu, etc.) and other full-video formats (in-banner, in-app, etc.), but does not include video in social networks – is the fastest growing medium (+34% CAGR from ’10 to ‘21) taking share from both TV (+0% CAGR from ’10 to ’21) and digital ex.

In our view, Netflix will be the primary beneficiary of $34bn spent on digital advertising within its markets ($16.3bn in the US) and of the exponential growth in digital video advertising.

Advertising spend per capital is defined as the country’s total advertising spend in a year divided by the population. For example, in Germany, advertisers spend half the per capita vs. the US – so it would be reasonable to assume Netflix could command half the CPM. In developing countries, however, Netflix is likely not targeting the entire population but rather the wealthier demographics (we believe their mobile-only plan seeks to target the rest). If we look at only the top 20% of the population in Brazil (which account for 55% of the GDP), the advertising spend per capita is 3x higher than the advertising spend per capita across the entire population. We note that Antenna data shows households in the US are equally likely to downgrade to ad-supported regardless of income, validating our view that the AVOD tier is still primarily meant for wealthier households. $0 $50,000 $100,000 $150,000 $200,000 $250,000 $300,000 $0 $100,000 $200,000 $300,000 Other, '10-'21 CAGR = -5% Television, '10-'21 CAGR = 0% Digital ex.

Converting password sharing households to paying households provides an additional opportunity for long-term subscriber growth – although this may prove challenging to execute while maintaining the service’s pristine user experience. To aid with this initiative, the company has announced it will offer the ability to transfer profiles which should help accommodate password sharers if they wish to establish their own subscriber account. In other words, password sharing households must pay more or they will be cut off from the service. The company has been testing strategies in a few markets and have highlighted two such strategies. In Peru, accounts can add up to 2 additional users outside of the household for ~$2 USD/month each. In Argentina, accounts can add up to 3 additional households for ~$2 USD/month each. Netflix has ultimately decided to deploy password sharing policies using the latter strategy starting in 2023. If, for example, 50% of global password sharing households could be converted to paying households at $2 USD/month, we believe Netflix could generate an incremental $1.2bn in revenue per year. We expect this revenue will flow through with an extremely high margin because: (1) there will be no incremental content costs, (2) Netflix already bears the cost to serve these households (namely server costs) and (3) there will need no for additional marketing spend to capture these households – they already know about and use Netflix. $0.60 $0.05 $0.40 $0.29 $0.44 $0.19 $0.41 $0.23 $0.04 $0.20 $0.63 $0.88 $0.00 $0.30 $0.60 $0.90 $1.20 $0.15 $0.40 $0.45 $0.09 $0.40 $0.00 $0.20 $0.40 $0.60 Brazil Italy Korea Mexico Spain CR\n",

For instance, if Netflix is able to convert 35% of households via $2 per additional household, 3.5% via the Basic + Ads tier and 1.5% via the Basic tier annually, they will generate an incremental >$1bn in revenue from the incremental 3mn subscribers (and 20.6mn of additional paying households which accounts for 68% conversion) by ’25 in UCAN alone, as shown in Exhibit 22.

At its peak in 2019, we estimate there were approximately 715mn households (or 47% of households) globally ex. China paying for TV. We continue to believe this serves as a practical TAM for streaming since these household were already making the discretionary decision to pay for entertainment (often with lower quality and/or at higher prices than Netflix offerings). Notably, even after contemplating password sharing, Netflix adoption remains substantially lower in APAC ex. China. We believe the launch of Basic + Ads (and mobile-only) will serve as an good opportunity to not only close the ga p in penetration, but also expand their TAM into the more price-sensitive households.

This local content will be utilized to acquire, engage, and retain new customers in these unique geographies (although the content can be leveraged globally). About half of new content Netflix is developing are productions based outside of the U.S. as of March 2021 of which nearly 40% is non-English language content. This shift in focus towards international has been occurring for several years, with Netflix doubling its investment in non-English content from 2019 to 2020. Interestingly, non-English language content has played double duty with shows including Squid Games, Lupin, and Money Heist driving significant engagement across the globe. Given the opportunity and lower penetration rates in geographies outside the U.S., we anticipate international markets will continue to drive significant content investment in coming years.

With the introduction of several significant streaming alternatives, we believe churn remains a key metric of concern.  Longer term, we ultimately believe engagement is a proxy for the platform’s consumer value and as long as NFLX continues to command significant viewership, there should be capacity to increase prices over time without driving significant increases in churn.

Streaming represented only 34.8% of total viewership (of which NFLX was 8%), which compares to 34.4% on Cable and 21.6% on Broadcast – suggesting there remains significant runway for future overall streaming growth. We anticipate the mix of TV viewing – and dollars spent on TV viewing – will continue to shift in favor of streaming in the coming years, and Netflix should be a primary beneficiary. Netflix is also exploring other opportunities to drive incremental engagement with their platform such as mobile viewing (lower ARPU and international-only) and gaming which, if successful, could also support further price increases in our view. Inflection point in margins and FCF generation We believe it is highly unlikely that streaming margins will ever approach the 50%+ margins of pay-TV because these businesses have fundamental differences including: 1) international footprint, 2) more competition (particularly from companies such as Apple and Amazon who have different profit motives), 3) increased tech and marketing costs for each individual service and 4) lower switching costs combined with an ability for consumers to create their own content bundles.

In addition, streaming services require a constant cadence of new content to acquire and retain subscribers which has driven content spending increases across the industry.  While it appears this content spending should moderate on a go-forward basis, it remains at an elevated level, which makes it more challenging to scale these services profitably when compared to the traditional Pay-TV model. Fortunately for NFLX, at their current subscriber level, they have reached “exit velocity” where they are now generating positive free cash flow and operating margins of ~17%. As Netflix continues to scale, we expect to see additional efficiencies in technology (i.e. scale discounts for server hosting) and marketing (i.e. content can “self-market”) along with moderating growth from the content spend side. From CY18 to CY21, Netflix has grown cash content spend at a CAGR of approximately +13%, the bulk of which we believe was in-house productions (and the associated costs to build in-house production capabilities). We estimate cash spent on produced content assets has increased at a +33% CAGR from CY18-CY21 whereas cash spent on licensed content assets has contracted by -2% over the same time period. With the most cash-intensive part of their transition behind them, it is our view that Netflix will moderate their growth in content spend and instead focus on the efficiency of their spending.

We forecast Netflix will grow FCF from $1bn in 2022E to $4.1bn in 2024E, representing a CY22-24E CAGR of approximately 99%. 7% 10% 13% 18% 21% 17% 18% 21% 0.0% 10.0% 20.0% 30.0% $0 $5,000,000 $10,000,000 $15,000,000 $20,000,000 $25,000,000 Operating P rofit Op erating Margin 31% 37% 38% 39% 42% 39% 40% 43% 0.0% 20.0% 40.0% 60.0% $0 $5,000,000 $10,000,000 $15,000,000 $20,000,000 $25,000,000 $30,000,000 $35,000,000 $40,000,000 Amortized Content Cost Gross Profit Gross Margin CR\n",

To date, the bulk of subscriber growth is from developed markets, where broadband infrastructure is mature. With these markets reaching saturation, subscriber growth in developing markets is becoming increasingly important. However, broadband infrastructure in these markets is still nascent, fundamentally limiting Netflix’s subscriber growth to the pace of broadband build-out which is very capital- and time-intensive. Exhibit 38: Broadband vs. Smartphone Penetration in Select Developing Markets Smartphone penetration is much higher  than broadband penetration in developing markets Sourc e: BofA Global Research, S&P Capital IQ, NewZoo BofA GLOBAL R ESEAR CH This limiting factor has pushed Netflix to pursue mobile-only offerings in developing markets, starting with India/Malaysia in 2019, Poland in 2020, and sub-Saharan Africa in 2021 (including a free plan in Kenya). In these markets, smartphones are further along their adoption curve than broadband, presenting incremental opportunity for a mobile- only offering. For example, in India, there are ~23mn broadband households but ~600mn -$4,000 -$2,000 $0 $2,000 $4,000 $6,000 $8,000 $10,000 $12,000 F CF Share Repurchase Debt Paydown Endin g Cash -$1.8 -$3.0 -$3.3 $1.9 -$0.2 $1.0 $2.3 $4.1 -$4.0 -$3.0 -$2.0 -$1.0 $0.0 $1.0 $2.0 $3.0 $4.0 $5.0 2017A 2018A 2019A 2020A 2021A 2022E 2023E 2024E F CF FCF '22E-'24E CAGR = 99.0% 7.5% 46.3% 33.7% 51.5% 7.7% 43.6% 61.6% 60.7% 65.5% 54.1% 0.0% 20.0% 40.0% 60.0% 80.0% India Brazil Phillipines Thailand South Africa Broadband Penetration Smartphone Pen etration CR\n",

Exhibit 39: Incremental Mobile TAM in Selected Develo ping Markets The mobile-only TAM in developing markets presents an incremental opportunity Sourc e: BofA Global Research,  S&P Capital IQ, NewZoo BofA GLOBAL R ESEAR CH Key investment risks The stream has become a deluge: competition heating up For many years, Netflix largely stood alone as a major, world-class streaming content provider. Over the last few years, major media companies including Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, CMCSA/NBCU and Paramount have shifted their focus towards streaming content distribution and devoted significant resources towards building out their respective platforms. As a result, these companies have garnered nearly 400mn subscribers in aggregate, including ~300mn net adds since 2Q19 as they began to ramp offerings (including the launch of Disney+ in 4Q19). We believe these trends are likely to continue as streaming slates from traditional M&E companies are set to strengthen in coming quarters (particularly Disney+) and Hollywood film releases recover from pandemic related delays with those films subsequently arriving on streaming platforms, generally 45 days post-theatrical release. These services will likely also benefit from recent and continued international rollouts potentially limiting Netflix’s growth in those markets. $1,555 $3,021 $832 $1,326 $147 $13,096 $2,978 $1,865 $1,123 $1,080 $0 $4,000 $8,000 $12,000 $16,000 India Brazil Phillipines Thailand South Africa Broadband-only TAM Mobile-only  TAM CR\n",

We note WBD is just getting started with their combined DTC strategy. BofA GLOBAL R ESEAR CH In addition to the aggressive pivot from legacy media companies, large tech companies (e.g. AMZN/AAPL) have also built out their own streaming capabilities. These companies present a particular challenge to Netflix: They are not strictly focused on the profitability of their streaming operations, but rather they are utilizing streaming as part of a broader strategy to attract consumers to other offerings and their overall ecosystem. With the proliferation of streaming options now presented to consumers, Netflix’s incumbent position as the largest platform places the company in the crosshairs of competitors. Indeed, during 1H22 Netflix lost a total of 1.2mn subscribers as the streaming market has become more crowded. Notably, Antenna reported an uptick (from 4Q21 to 1Q22) of users who cancelled Netflix and subscribed to another SVOD service within a month.

      "Pages:  Netflix, Inc. | 15 November 2022    29 investment activity towards wholly owned DTC offerings, As part of this pivot, traditional studios, which have developed the competency to produce high-quality content over a number of decades, are also keeping some of their key content and IP exclusively for their own respective platforms. As it became apparent that traditional studios were going to keep key content in-house, Netflix began to shift towards original productions. While Netflix has produced a number of well received hit titles, we believe there is significant execution risk as the company attempts to replace lost content through its own studio and produce a constant stream of hits that rival its competition. As such, we believe there are concerns about the efficiency of Netflix’s content spend relative to output and quality. When the company was consistently adding new subscribers, investors were largely willing to overlook the magnitude of their content spend, but now that new subscribers are decelerating and competition is intensifying, we believe Netflix’s content spend is under greater scrutiny and investors will require more efficiency and a higher ROI per dollar spent. Importantly, evidence is already emerging that relative to other services NFLX appears to have a lower “hit rate” for its original programming. As shown in Exhibit 44, according to Parrot Analytics from June 2020-June 2021, the average Netflix original underperformed Starz, Disney+, HBO, Apple TV+, and Hulu. We believe this highlights a challenge to Netflix as other operators scale their streaming platforms and Netflix loses a key advantage as the first-place con sumers look to for new programming. Relatively sparse trove of valuable IP Traditional media companies have vast troves of well-known, highly regarded and branded IP from which to develop for new titles. For example, Disney+ has Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, National Geographic and other unique IP. WBD maintains ownership of DC Comics, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones, among others. Due to its limited history as a content creator Netflix has yet to develop a stockpile of valuable IP. In our view, this will make it more difficult for the company to reach its goal of developing a constant stream of hits. Partially as a function of its more limited IP, Netflix has spent significantly on creative talent (e.g. Shonda Rhimes, Ryan Murphy) in hopes of developing new franchises. CR\n",

The transition toward streaming requires significant content and technology investments that benefit companies with scale.  Relatively sub-scale content creators are likely recognizing the risks and challenges of competing against deep pocketed industry behemoths while managing the cannibalization risks from existing linear revenue streams.  Meanwhile, larger creators are in search of additional scale and distribution opportunities and will continue to view smaller content producers and networks as attractive potential targets.  We believe these dynamics were primary drivers of Amazon’s acquisition of MGM and the merger between Discovery and WarnerMedia.  As industry competitors consolidate further, the resulting larger entities will have increased financial capacity and reach to more effectively compete against NFLX’s global platform. To date, NFLX has appeared to be an unwilling buyer of media assets. Management has long stated it would only make acquisitions of unencumbered assets that fit right into their core product. However, as the competitive landscape intensifies, we would not preclude NFLX becoming a net acquirer as a way to increase content or engagement on their platform (e.g. franchises or gaming). Conversely, Netflix could also be an attractive takeover target for many companies, in our view. Account sharing may limit subscriber potential Netflix has highlighted that there are 100mn+ households, including 30mn+ in UCAN, sharing the service with paying accounts. Converting these 100mn+ households to paying subscribers may prove challenging, although we are encouraged by initial details form Netflix’s plan to monetize password sharing accounts. Nevertheless, if converting these households proves challenging, Netflix may be further along its adoption curve than subscriber accounts imply as Exhibits 46-49 illustrate. 0.0x 0.5x 1.0x 1.5x 2.0x 2.5x 3.0x 3.5x 4.0x 4.5x 5.0x 5.5x Amazon Netfl ix Hulu Apple TV+ HBO Disney+ Starz 0 60 120 180 2019 2020 2021 2022 CR\n",

      "Pages:  Netflix, Inc. | 15 November 2022    33 Price objective basis & risk Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Our $370 price objective is 20.5x our CY2024E EBITDA and is supported by our DCF valuation which assumes an approximate 5% terminal growth rate and 11% WACC. We believe a premium to the market's 11x multiple is warranted given Netflix' superior EBITDA growth (CY19A-24E CAGR of 26% vs. the market's 7%), although a discount to historical peak levels of approximately 24x due to structurally lower growth expectations. Downside risks to our price objective are: (1) the heightened competition from traditional M&A companies (DIS, WBD and PARA) and large tech. companies (AAPL and AMZN), (2) a wave of industry consolidation resulting in larger entities with increased financial capacity and reach to effectively compete with NFLX, (3) the efficiency of NFLX's content spend relative to output and quality, and (4) an effectively higher penetration (particularly in UCAN) if password sharing initiatives prove challenging.

FUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflec t the analyst’s assessment of both a stock’s: absolute total return potential as well as its attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12 month total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current pric e objectiv e for a stock should be referenc ed to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).

BofA ESGMeter Methodology: ESGMeter is a proprietary metric based on quantitative analysis and fundamental analyst inputs that reflects our assessment of a company's Environmental, Social and Governance-related attributes. The ESGMeter is intended to indicate a company's likelihood of experiencing stronger financial stability (higher return on equity and lower earnings and price volatility) over the next three years relative to peer group. There are three ESGMeter levels - Low, Medium, and High - which indicate whether a company has attributes most likely to translate into superior financial stability (in the case of a High level) or weaker financial stability (in the case of a Low level) over the next three years relative to its peer group. A Medium level suggests that a company exhibits ESG characteristics that are likely associated with financial stability results in line with its peer group over the next three years. Full details of our methodology, financial stability definition and disclaimers are available at BofA ESGMeter methodology. ESGMeter is not indicative of a company's future stock price performance and is not an investment recommendation or rating. ESGMeter is independent of the BofA Global Research fundamental equity analyst's investment rating, volatility risk rating, income rating or price objective for that company.
