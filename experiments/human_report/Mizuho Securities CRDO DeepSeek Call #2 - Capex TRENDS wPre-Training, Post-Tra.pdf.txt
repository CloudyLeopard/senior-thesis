DeepSeek Call #2 - Capex TRENDS w/Pre-Training, Post-Training,
Inference, Tariffs
We hosted an industry call focused on Gen AI/Agentic, and CSP Capex trends from new
models. Key takeaways: 1) MMLU benchmarks show parameter scaling still important
in Pre-Training Foundation models and could drive GPU demand, but potential plateau
in 2-3Y, 2) AI also moving to Inference/reinforcement learning (IF/RL) with new Qwen/
DS-R1/GeminiR2/Manus though requires ~10% GPU load vs. pre-training - but IF/RL
workloads could grow SIGNIFICANTLY driving bigger GPU ramps, 3) China Ascend 910a/
c at 50% lower cost, unstable but improving performance, though H20 STRONG, and 4)
TARIFFS exposure risk as ~28% of US Servers made in Mexico. Adjusting ests/PTs for
AMD/NVDA with lower AI peer group multiples - BUT major catalyst ahead with GTC -
Mar 18th as we see GB300 and potentially a 288-GPU GB200-NVL72 rack, with potential
Optics-CPO/Quantum compute roadmaps from global AI leader NVDA next week.
Key Points
Parameter Scaling in Pre-Training KEY to Foundation Model Performance But Post-
Training/Inference Workloads Increasing.  Despite recent headlines about Qwen 32B
and DeepSeek, we believe core investments on Foundation models KEY requiring
increased parameter scaling to improve model quality. As weshow in Ex-1,  MMLU perf
to parameters has not plateaued and argues for continued parameter scaling, or larger
Foundation models and bigger GPU clusters . However, we believe AI workloads are
shifting increasingly to post-training (fine-tuning), and inference, now at ~50-80% of
workloads. Though RL currently only utilize ~10% of GPU load and ~15% of time versus
pre-training, increasing post-training/RL parameters and inference (test time scaling,
AgenticAI) COULD require >10x more compute  driving GPU/Custom ASIC demand
growth. We estimate a 300B parameter foundation model in pre-training could use
10-20K GPU and 1.5 months, while post training/RL/inferencing can be done on ~10%
the GPUs for 300B in ~7 days, but could scale over time with more RL/reasoning.
Ascend 910a/c at 50% LOWER $/Compute, Unstable vs. Competitors BUT Improved.
Our call noted the Ascend 910a/c GPU is 50% cheaper ($/compute) versus H100 -
but UNSTABLE during training with daily interruptions (we estimate NVDA ~7x more
stable vs. Ascend) driving significant pull-in demand for H20 ahead of potential future AI
restrictions.
US-MEX 20% ex-USMCA Tariff Could Impact Server ODMs (Ex-4) but Cost Pass
Through. We believe DELL (Outperform, $140 PT) and SMCI (Neutral, $50 PT) could
have potential server manufacturing in MEX, which could be subject to the new
~20% tariffs ( LINK), BUT we see geographically dispersed/balanced supply chains
mitigating headwinds, though we see near-term increased costs passed through to CSP/
hyperscalers. Longer term, we see supply chains potentially repositioning to US/Asia/
Mex, depending on investment/cost/capacity/labor tradeoff considerations.
Adjusting estimates/PTs for AMD/NVDA, no changes for AVGO/CRDO/INTC. For AMD,
lower estimates/PT to $120 (prior $140). For NVDA, no change to estimates, lower PT
$168 (prior $175) with lower peer group multiples - BUT major catalyst ahead with GTC-
Mar 18th as we see 1) GB300 launch 2) potential big 2H with GB200 restart, AprQ GMs
bottoming 3) potentially a 288-GPU GB200-NVL72 rack and 4) potential Optics-CPO/
Quantum compute road maps from global AI leader NVDA next week.

Parameter Scaling in Pre-Training Key to Foundation Model
Performance. Despite recent headlines with Qwen 32B and
DeepSeek, we believe there will still be core investments focused
on driving increased parameter scaling in Foundation/frontier
models to drive increased performance as many LLMs are
not interested in hurting progress in model development by
buying lower quality GPUs. We believe pre-training scaling will
remain a key driver of GPU/ASIC capex, but increasing focus
is shifting to post-training and inference. Post-training includes
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), RL
with human feedback (RLHF), quantized low-rank adaptation
(QLoRA), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We see the
market shifting from 50/50 inference/training currently to closer
to 80/20 as RL becomes more prominent, driving higher needs
for GPUs and custom ASICs with user counts and instances
ramping.
Exhibit 1 - MMLU Performance Shows Parameter
Scaling Still KEY to Perf
Source: Epoch AI, MSUSA Estimates
Cheaper inference GPUs to compete with NVDA but potentially only longer-term as near-term
dynamic model architectures and immature software ensures NVDA dominance with CUDA.
We believe our speaker noted Ascend 910 GPUs are ~50% cheaper vs. H100, with stability issues
improving rapidly but still lagging significantly (~5-10% reliability vs. NVDA). We believe the AI/
ML landscape continues to change rapidly, with inference workload also shifting, from supervised
fine-tuning, to RL, test-time compute, and agentic AI, all of which continues to benefit NVDA with
its HW-optimized software compatibility for changing workloads. In addition, pre-training scaling
could continue to drive demand for the largest AI clusters, all of which we believe could use NVDA's
leading edge products, with GB200 in 2025 and Rubin in 2026. In addition, there is a 36x difference
in inference cost vs. only ~8% difference in test scores (Ex-3, o1 vs. DS R1).

20% tariffs could impact AI Server shipments from Mexico,
driving higher prices and supply chain disruption.  Mexico
was the US's largest provider of "servers" (Automatic Data
Processing machines, "ADP", HTS code 8471)  accounting for
an average of 28% of total "servers" imported into the US.  We
believe a 20% tariff in the near-term (3-6 months could see
prices passed through), while longer term could force existing
ODMs with Mexico facilities (including: Hon Hai, Quanta, Wiwynn,
Inventec, Pegatron, Wistron, Compal) to increase investment
into the US, likely leading to higher prices than even 25%, or
could force a shift manufacturing to East Asia, which could take
3-6 months to ramp capacity to meet strong customer demand.
This could potentially be a headwind to an already slim ODM
margin profile as costs trend up in the US with competition also
increasing.

ASICs Driving Lower TCO as More Inference Use Cases Ramp
We continue to see AVGO as the leading ASIC partner due to its strong relationship with GOOGL
(Covered by James Lee, Outperform, $230PT) on TPU, META (Covered by James Lee, Outperform,
$750PT) with MTIA and Bytedance. We would note we estimate AVGO ASIC share at ~75-80% in
2024 with a total market SAM of $18-20B, potentially increasing ~3-5x to as much as $60-90B
by 2027E as it continues to ramp with its 3 key customers. Recently, AVGO noted it could see
additional ramps of 2 more hyperscale customers (we believe with Baltra and Strawberry) in 2026E,
while also seeing strong discussions with 2 additional potential customers ( Link), none of which
are included in its SAM estimates. We believe hyperscalers will continue to focus on ramping ASIC
deployments to drive down TCO, specifically for inference, as they look to add more enterprise
customers to their clouds.

Adjusting Ests/PT for AMD and NVDA PT, No Change to INTC/AVGO/CRDO
For AMD, no change to our MarQ Rev/EPS estimates at $7.10B/$0.95 (cons. $7.10/$0.94), while
lowering F25E from $32.2B/$5.00 to $31.9B/$4.70 (cons. $31.9B/$4.66) and F26E from $39.1B/
$7.00 to $38.3B/$6.33 ($38.4B/$6.29). Reiterate AMD at Outperform and lower PT to $120 (prior:
$140), 19.0x F26E P/E (prior: 20.0x) as we see continued headwinds to AMD's AI growth with it
having trouble securing CoWoS share, while NVDA remains the dominant leader in the merchant
GPU market, but we see share gains in traditional server and PC as key tailwinds.
For NVDA, no change to NVDA estimates and reiterate our Outperform, but lower PT to $168,
31.1x our F27E P/E, as we pull in our PT with multiple compression in the AI space overall due to

fears of slowing growth, but we continue to see NVDA dominating with a superior HW/SW stack
as it ramps Blackwell and maintains leadership with CUDA.
No change to INTC/AVGO/CRDO estimates or PTs of $23/$250/$90, respectively as we continue
to see INTC with share loss headwinds win PC/server end markets, but we note potential tailwinds
from a foundry spin (Link), as well as its new CEO (Link), AVGO seeing AI tailwinds as the custom
ASIC leader, and CRDO benefiting from both the scale up and scale out of AI clusters, while driving
better performance with its "n-1" process.

Price Target Calculation and Key Risks
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)
Investment Thesis
We see AMD well-positioned as a second-place AI accelerator competitor after enjoying continued strength in DC compute with share
gains as it ramps its Zen 5 Turin with missteps from its competitor. We believe AI accelerator demand remains strong as MI325x/355x
ramp in 2025E, with a strong roadmap to MI400X and beyond driving into the ~$500B AI accelerator market by 2028E (~60% 23-28E
CAGR), currently dominated by NVDA, with upside from an estimated ~MSD% market share. 2025E could see continued strong roadmap
execution with Zen 6 Medusa and Venice.
Base Case/PT
With AMD gaining server share, a potential PC rebound and upcoming AI product launches, we see a base case PT of $120, ~19.0x
our F26E P/E.
Bull Case/PT
If AMD can win significant server/DC market and capitalize on growth in AI, AMD could drive EPS to $5.60 with accretive GMs and better
than expected Instinct ramps, implying a bull case PT of ~$160 and a 23.0x F26E P/E with a $6.96 EPS.
Bear Case/PT
If AMD is unable to maintain current roadmap execution momentum and loses server market share, AMD could see growth decline,
leading to a downside EPS of $5.75, with a 15.6x F26E P/E and implying a bear case PT of ~$90.
Risks
AMD could see challenges with an AI slowdown into 2025 or a PC market rebound in 2025E not materializing. We also believe INTC
proves more of a threat to AMD vs. prior years with its new product roadmap which could slow or reverse AMD’s recent share gains.
We would also note AMD remains a distant second supplier to NVDA in the AI GPU race, with limited CoWoS allocations potentially
limiting growth.
NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)
Investment Thesis
We see NVDA remaining the leader in the AI training and inference chips for Data Center applications (we estimate >95% share today),
which we believe is growing at a 74% CAGR to >$400B by 2027E. Gaming GPUs (we estimate >75% PC share) are expected to remain
healthy and stable, while NVDA’s automotive ADAS pipeline remains strong. We continue to see NVDA executing its roadmap, with
GB200 and NVL72/36 ramping in 2025E, as well as increasing its AI server content via the Grace CPU. We believe headwinds from China
AI chip restrictions remain muted. We also see upgrade cycle opportunity for the RTX 50-series as RTX 40-series penetration remains
at ~10% of the PC market, as NVDA could see a >$10B/yr Gaming revenue run rate.
Base Case/PT
NVDA remains well positioned in the machine learning, deep learning, and AI markets. Our $168 PT reflects ~31.1x F27E P/E, still within
its historical range ~20-65x as it retains >75-90% market share in merchant DC/AI.
Bull Case/PT
NVDA has significant market leading opportunities in the AI/DC, Gaming, and Automotive markets, which could drive F27E EPS to ~
$5.94 and a share price of ~$250, ~42.1x F27E P/E.
Bear Case/PT
If NVDA is unable to maintain strong growth in key markets as well as fails to continue to capitalize on AI opportunities, we could see
it trading closer to ~20.4x our bear case F27E EPS of ~$4.91, implying a share price of ~$100.
Risks
Escalations of export restrictions to China and other geopolitical tensions (Taiwan) or a significant pullback in AI Server spending could
be major headwinds. We would also note limited CoWoS capacity at TSMC, and other suppliers, potential for FTC lawsuits, and growing
competition both domestically and in China, pose additional challenges.

Industry Report
Semiconductors & Semiconductor Capital Equipment
Intel Corporation (INTC)
Investment Thesis
We believe a new CEO could provide opportunities with a vision to return the company to growth and a trajectory to catch up with key
peers AMD/NVDA in AI, Server, and PC. INTC's market opportunities remain abundant with leading share in server CPU, strong, but
declining, market share in PC, and a lagging AI portfolio with Gaudi/Falcon Shores. However, we see challenges with execution as its
foundry roadmap remains weak, while its AI accelerator roadmap lags both AMD/NVDA. We do see FPGA spinoff a value-adding driver,
but overall remain on the sidelines with multiple headwinds and lacking company vision. We continue to see the potential spin-off/sale
of its foundry business as long-term positive.
Base Case/PT
While INTC has multiple potential tailwinds including AI opportunities, IFS expansion, margin improvements and the FPGA spin,
execution in these key segments has been weak with soft AI and server traction and PC share loss. We rate INTC Neutral with a $23
PT, ~19.5x our F26E EPS.
Bull Case/PT
If INTC can generate better than expected DC/AI revenues, successfully ramp IFS, or unlock value with business unit spin-offs, INTC
could see a $29PT at ~22.4x F26E EPS.
Bear Case/PT
If INTC has issues with new nodes/product ramps, sees softer DC/AI, or sees foundry setbacks, we believe it could lead to share gains
for AMD and NVDA, leading to a bear case PT at ~$17, or ~15.9x F26E EPS.
Risks
INTC will need to continue to execute in 2025E on its process node roadmap as well as gain traction in its Foundry business, while it
continues its search to find new leadership. Further missteps could see it lose further share to AMD in PC and/or Server, as well as fall
farther behind in the AI race to NVDA.
Broadcom Inc. (AVGO)
Investment Thesis
AVGO remains an industry leader with strong profitability, GM/OM at ~79%/66% and FCF/year growing toward ~$33B by F25E while
benefiting from key secular AI drive tailwinds for its networking and custom ASIC business. AVGO could benefit from accelerating AI
tailwinds with AI revenue potentially growing to >$50B by F27E (up 4x vs. F24) with a current custom silicon SAM of ~$17.5B (AVGO
~70% share) potentially growing to $60-90B with AI networking Tomahawk and Jericho outpaces Infiniband as 800G/1.6T transitions
take hold. We continue to see strength in its broad semiconductor portfolio including Wireless (iPhone), Networking (Tomahawk, Jericho,
Trident), Storage, Broadband (Wifi6/6e/7), and Software, where >90% of bookings are recurring and F25E revenue is estimated at ~
$61.6B. We see iPhone content remaining strong, ramping into iPhone 16 with potential for further gains in 17, while VMWare integration
trends ahead of schedule and visibility to $4B/Q run-rate.
Base Case/PT
We see AVGO well positioned with Networking and AI ramps, a strong position in Wireless, and margin-accretive software. We rate
AVGO Outperform, with a $250 PT based on ~31.2x our F26E EPS estimate.
Bull Case/PT
If AVGO can see improved AI opportunities in custom silicon and networking we believe AVGO could see a Bull case PT of ~$350, with
an $8.65 upside F26E EPS, indicating a ~41x F26E P/E.
Bear Case/PT
The company could see headwinds in key growth drivers in Networking/AI with increasing competition, representing a Bear case PT
of ~$160, 21.6x our downside F26E EPS of $7.41.
Risks
AVGO competes in a cyclical, technologically intensive industry and sells to a concentrated customer base. Risks include, among other
factor, AVGO’s continued success of its research and development efforts, and execution of its new products, dependence on contract
manufacturing and third-party manufacturers, customer concentration, competition, and pricing pressure from possible new market

entrants from China, Asia-Pacific, or Taiwan. We could also see changes in legal and regulatory requirements, tariffs and exchange
rates limiting growth.
Credo Technology Group Hldg (CRDO)
Investment Thesis
CRDO is a technology innovator with strength in SerDes IP, server interconnect products with its AEC (active electrical cables), Optical
DSP, Line Card PHY, chiplets, and IP licensing. CRDO is actively engaged with all seven major hyperscalers, as well as CSP, Enterprise,
and Networking customers and is benefiting from increased AI infrastructure spending for its Optical and AEC solutions. CRDO has
strong GMs at ~64% (in-line with its LT 63-65%), and we believe is an attractive company with competitive advantages in SerDes IP
that can drive materially lower TCO in Data Centers compared to the competition with a TAM potentially 20x its current AEC revenue
run rate of $300M/yr.
Base Case/PT
Our $90 PT is ~24x our F26E P/S and represents our base case scenario. We view CRDO as a leader, with a full suite of products
addressing the 400G+ market, growing 2x overall DC market.
Bull Case/PT
If CRDO can successfully ramp at its 3 key hyperscale customers, ramp capacity and potentially add additional hyperscale customers,
as well as see overall faster 400G/800G ramps, it could see benefits to its top and bottom lines. Our upside case scenario implies a
$140PT, and ~35x our upside F26E P/Sales.
Bear Case/PT
If CRDO sees tougher than expected competition, fails to sustain traction with AEC, or sees a slowdown in DC, we see CRDO trading
at $50, ~15x our downside F26E P/Sales.
Risks
CRDO is sensitive to spending from a few large customers in the Data Center market, including US/China hyperscalers and CSPs. While
an advantage typically, if its customers significantly pull back on buildouts and investment, then this could negatively impact CRDO’s
growth. Competition, mainly from AVGO and MRVL, could be headwinds to CRDO, as well exposure to China customers, and TSMC as
its sole source foundry partner.
