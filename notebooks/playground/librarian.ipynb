       "[Document(text='Tariffs\\nAdvertisement\\nHyundai already makes cars in the United States, in Georgia and Alabama.\\ntranscript\\nToday, we’re delighted to report that Hyundai is announcing a major $5.8 billion investment in American manufacturing. In particular, Hyundai will be building a brand new steel plant in Louisiana, which will produce more than 2.7 million metric tons of steel, a year, creating more than 1,400 jobs for American steel workers. And then there’ll be major expansion after that. This investment is a clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work. Hyundai will be producing steel in America and making its cars in America, and as a result, they’ll not have to pay any tariffs. There are no tariffs if you make your product in America.\\nBy Jack Ewing\\nHyundai Motor, a South Korean conglomerate known for its automobiles, will invest $21 billion to expand manufacturing in the United States in what President Trump said was proof that his tariff policies were creating jobs.\\nThe company, which also produces steel, said on Monday that the investment through 2028 would include $6 billion for a steel factory in Louisiana that would employ 1,300 people and for other projects to supply Hyundai factories with parts and materials.\\nThe company will also spend $9 billion to expand production of Hyundai, Kia and Genesis vehicles in the United States. The rest of the money will be used for projects that include expanding supplies of renewable energy, building more electric vehicle chargers and conducting research on robots and autonomous driving.\\n“Money is pouring in,” Mr. Trump said at the White House in an event that included Gov. Jeff Landry of Louisiana and Euisun Chung, the executive chair of Hyundai. “This investment is a clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work.”\\nMr. Trump has threatened to impose new tariffs on a wide range of foreign goods, including automobiles, and by promising to invest more in the United States, Hyundai may help South Korea avoid tariffs or at least be subject to lower duties than other countries.\\nHyundai already has significant investments in the United States. Last year, the company began producing electric vehicles at a factory near Savannah, Ga., that cost $7.6 billion to build. On Wednesday, Hyundai plans to host an event to show off the complex.\\nAlong with SK On, a South Korean battery maker, Hyundai is investing another $5 billion to produce electric vehicle batteries near Atlanta.\\nMr. Chung gave Mr. Trump credit for the Georgia investments, saying they were initiated when the president visited Seoul in 2019 during his first term. “We are really proud to stand with you and proud to build the future together,” Mr. Chung said.\\nThe Hyundai factories in Georgia also benefited from subsidies passed by Democrats during the Biden administration, although that support was not mentioned at the White House on Monday.\\nHyundai also makes vehicles in Montgomery, Ala. Kia builds cars in West Point, Ga., southwest of Atlanta.\\nThe factories provide Hyundai with some immunity from tariffs that the Trump administration has imposed or threatened on steel and cars. By reducing Hyundai’s costs from tariffs, the U.S. factories could also give the company a competitive advantage over rivals like Ford Motor and General Motors, which import many of their electric vehicles from Mexico. Mr. Trump has threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico next month.\\n“There are no tariffs if you make your product in America,” said Mr. Trump, who reiterated plans to impose tariffs on imported automobiles in days to come.\\nJack Ewing writes about the auto industry with an emphasis on electric vehicles.

       " Document(text=\"Advertisement\\nSupported by\\nMr. Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, has restructured his company so that he no longer has a top deputy.\\nBy Sheera Frenkel and Mike Isaac\\nFor more than a decade, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg began and ended each week by meeting together.\\nThe symbolism of the ritual was clear. It was intended to signal that Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, and Ms. Sandberg, the chief operating officer, were in lock step with each other at the top of the company.\\nBut when Ms. Sandberg, 52, said on Wednesday that she would step down from Meta this fall, she crystallized an unspoken change at the tech giant: Mr. Zuckerberg no longer has any clear No. 2.\\nWhile Mr. Zuckerberg named Javier Olivan, a longtime executive, to take over Ms. Sandberg’s job when she departs, the importance of the chief operating officer role has diminished at Meta, which was formerly known as Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg, 38, instead has four executives who have equally large responsibilities and who answer to and run major decisions by him.\\nMr. Zuckerberg made the structural shift because he wanted to consolidate his control over all arms of the company, three people close to him said. While Mr. Zuckerberg has always been the undisputed boss, with a majority of the company’s voting shares, he shared power with Ms. Sandberg when he was a younger businessman and needed help expanding the company. But with more than 18 years of experience under his belt, he wants to exercise all of his power and be identified more clearly as Meta’s sole leader, the people said.\\nThe four top lieutenants are Andrew Bosworth, the chief technology officer; Nick Clegg , the president of global affairs; Chris Cox , the chief product officer; and Mr. Olivan, who was the head of growth, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a Facebook message about Ms. Sandberg’s exit on Wednesday.\\nEach of the four men has major responsibilities. Mr. Clegg is the public face and ambassador for Meta, while Mr. Bosworth is pushing the company into the immersive world of the so-called metaverse . Mr. Cox oversees Meta’s family of apps — Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook — and Mr. Olivan will be in charge of analytics, infrastructure and growth.\\nBut none of them have as much power as Ms. Sandberg used to, when she effectively ran all of the business operations while Mr. Zuckerberg focused on developing Facebook’s products.\\nMr. Zuckerberg alluded to the power shift on Wednesday in his Facebook post. He said he didn’t “plan to replace Sheryl’s role in our existing structure,” adding that Meta “has reached the point where it makes sense for our product and business groups to be more closely integrated, rather than having all the business and operations functions organized separately from our products.”\\nR.A. Farrokhnia, a professor at Columbia’s Business and Engineering Schools, said the shift in management structure made sense as Meta invested in the metaverse and moved away from the social networking model that Ms. Sandberg built an advertising business for and championed for years.\\n“Moving in this direction requires a more decentralized — and more traditional — governance structure,” Mr. Farrokhnia said. “You have multiple people coming together where the sum of the parts becomes much larger.”\\nA spokesman for Meta declined to provide interviews with executives.\\nFor years, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg had clear-cut responsibilities, which employees often referred to as the “Sandberg side” and “Mark side.” Ms. Sandberg ran the business, policy and legal teams with a lot of autonomy, while Mr. Zuckerberg was responsible for the engineering and product teams.\\nThat began changing in 2020 after Facebook dealt with scandals involving privacy, misinformation and other toxic content on the platform. Mr. Zuckerberg told his teams that he was done apologizing and wanted to focus more time and attention on innovative products that the company was designing.\\nSince then, Mr. Zuckerberg has assumed more control over public messaging and policy decisions, which Ms. Sandberg used to handle. He also brought in hires with public policy expertise and promoted longtime executives who were loyal to his vision.\\nThree executives he promoted were Mr. Bosworth and Mr. Cox, who have been at the company for 16 years, and Mr. Olivan, who joined nearly 15 years ago. They were among Mr. Zuckerberg’s earliest recruits, and were instrumental in building the earliest versions of Facebook.\\nMr. Olivan, 44, who is known internally as Javi, joined Facebook as head of international growth and rose steadily through the ranks. He is not a household name but oversaw Facebook’s rapid expansion and was closely involved with maintaining the company’s technical infrastructure.\\nMr. Bosworth, 40, is seen as an enthusiastic and sometimes brash cheerleader for Mr. Zuckerberg’s vision. In January, he was promoted to be the next chief technology officer . He oversees the virtual and augmented reality labs, which make products like the Quest virtual reality headsets that are at the heart of Mr. Zuckerberg’s push for the metaverse. He and Mr. Zuckerberg are also close friends who vacation together.\\nMr. Cox, 39, who became chief product officer in 2005, has often been described by employees as the heart of the company. He left Facebook in March 2019 but returned in June 2020, prompting speculation that Mr. Zuckerberg may have been signaling him as a successor.\\nDuring Mr. Cox’s absence, some of his teams were reassigned to report directly to Mr. Zuckerberg or other executives, said two senior Meta employees who have worked with Mr. Cox since his return. They said he had not assumed the type of expansive role he once had with thousands of engineers reporting to him.\\nA Meta spokeswoman disputed that Mr. Cox had fewer responsibilities and said he “returned to lead the same teams and since then has taken on additional responsibilities, expanding his organization.”\\nMr. Clegg, 55, joined the company in 2018 after a career in British politics, including a stint as deputy prime minister. Ms. Sandberg hired him to take over handling Facebook’s thorny political issues globally, a task that was once hers. Over time, he has become a kind of de facto head of state for the company, dealing with world governments and advocating for Meta at a regulatory level. In February, he was promoted to president of global affairs, reporting to Mr. Zuckerberg.\\nAt Meta, insiders have long speculated over who a potential successor to Mr. Zuckerberg would be, should he ever leave. Ms. Sandberg’s impending departure has now shortened that list and left no clear answers.\\n“Over the years, few folks other than Sheryl have emerged as a potential successor to Mark,” said Katie Harbath, a director of public policy at Meta who left the company last year. “It makes sense for Mark to want options for possible successors.”\\nShe added: “It can be risky to only focus on one person.”\\nSheera Frenkel is a prize-winning technology reporter based in San Francisco. In 2021, she and Cecilia Kang published, “An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook's Battle for Domination.” More about Sheera Frenkel\\nMike Isaac is a technology correspondent and the author of “Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber,” a best-selling book on the dramatic rise and fall of the ride-hailing company.

       " Document(text='Trump Administration\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nThe additions included companies that are customers of Intel and Nvidia, and one firm that was the focus of a New York Times investigation last year.\\nBy Ana Swanson\\nReporting from Washington\\nThe Trump administration on Tuesday added 80 companies and organizations to a list of companies that are barred from buying American technology and other exports because of national security concerns.\\nThe move, which targeted primarily Chinese firms, cracks down on companies that have been big buyers of American chips from Nvidia, Intel and AMD. It also closed loopholes that Trump administration officials have long criticized as allowing Chinese firms to continue to advance technologically despite U.S. restrictions.\\nOne company added to the list, Nettrix Information Industry, was the focus of a 2024 investigation by The New York Times that showed how some Chinese executives had bypassed U.S. restrictions aimed at cutting China off from advanced chips to make artificial intelligence.\\nNettrix, one of China’s largest makers of computer servers that are used to produce artificial intelligence, was started by a group of former executives from Sugon, a firm that provided advanced computing to the Chinese military and built a system the government used to surveil persecuted minorities in the western Xinjiang region.\\nIn 2019, the United States added Sugon to its “entity list,” restricting exports over national security concerns. The Times investigation found that, six months later, the executives formed Nettrix, using Sugon’s technology and inheriting some of its customers. Times reporters also found that Nettrix’s owners shared a complex in eastern China with Sugon and other related companies.\\nAfter Sugon was singled out and restricted by the United States, its longtime partners — Nvidia, Intel and Microsoft — quickly formed ties with Nettrix, the investigation found.\\nRecords obtained through WireScreen, a business intelligence platform, showed that Sugon and Nettrix have links to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a vast research institution that develops chip technology, parts of which the United States has placed under sanctions for national security concerns. Procurement documents indicated that Nettrix had sold servers to universities that host defense laboratories and cybersecurity firms that work with the military and on China’s Great Firewall, among other customers.\\nThe Trump administration added 54 companies and organizations from China to the entity list on Tuesday, as well as more than two dozen from Iran, Pakistan, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan.\\nThe added entities had made contributions to Pakistani nuclear activities and its missile program, advanced China’s quantum technology capabilities and hypersonic weapons development, and tried to circumvent U.S. controls on Iran, among other actions, the administration said.\\n“We will not allow adversaries to exploit American technology to bolster their own militaries and threaten American lives,” Howard Lutnick, the secretary of commerce, said in a statement.\\nThe Trump administration also expanded its penalties on Tuesday to several subsidiaries of Inspur Group, which has been a significant customer of Intel and other U.S. technology firms. The administration said those entities had aided Inspur’s development of supercomputers that were used by the Chinese military, and had tried to acquire U.S. technology in support of that.\\nThe Biden administration added Inspur’s parent company to the entity list in 2023, but after a brief pause, U.S. companies continued to do business with Inspur’s subsidiaries. Inspur Group moved its registered address to a location about a mile away from its parent group in 2023.\\nTrade experts have said the impact of U.S. entity listings can be easy for companies to dodge, because the entity listing is tied to a specific name and address.\\nTuesday’s entity listings together will affect a significant portion of the Chinese market for servers, a type of computer that is necessary to generate artificial intelligence. The Trump administration also added a special designation to its restrictions to expand the penalties globally, which will stop companies from trying to bypass U.S. rules by exporting products to the Chinese firms from countries other than the United States.\\nThe entity list was created under the Clinton administration to prevent adversaries from developing weapons of mass destruction, but presidents have wielded it increasingly aggressively over the past decade.\\nOther groups added to the list Tuesday included the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, which the administration said was added for trying to acquire A.I. models and chips in support of China’s military modernization.\\nAna Swanson covers trade and international economics for The Times and is based in Washington.

       " Document(text='Signal Leak\\nAdvertisement\\nMr. Goldberg, who was included on a private text thread discussing war plans, was a longtime national security reporter who became editor of The Atlantic in 2016.\\nBy Katie Robertson\\nJeffrey Goldberg may be one of the last journalists the Trump administration would want to inadvertently include on a private text thread discussing war plans. But according to Mr. Goldberg’s stunning revelation on Monday, that is exactly what happened.\\nMr. Goldberg, 59, was a well-known national security reporter before he took over as editor in chief of The Atlantic in 2016. He was born in Brooklyn and studied at the University of Pennsylvania before dropping out and moving to Israel to serve in the Israel Defense Forces. He wrote about his time as a prison guard in 1990, during the First Intifada, for a 2006 book, “Prisoners: A Muslim and a Jew Across the Middle East Divide.” He also began a career in journalism while in Israel as a columnist for The Jerusalem Post.\\nMr. Goldberg returned to the United States and worked as a police reporter at The Washington Post. He wrote for New York magazine and The New York Times Magazine, and became the New York bureau chief of the Jewish newspaper The Forward. In 2000, The New Yorker hired him as its Middle East correspondent, a role he held for five years before becoming the Washington correspondent.\\nIn 2007, he was lured to The Atlantic after its owner, David Bradley, sent ponies to Mr. Goldberg’s Washington home for his three young children. He took over as its editor in chief nine years later.\\nUnder Mr. Goldberg’s editorship, The Atlantic won its first Pulitzer Prize, in 2021, and also won one in 2022 and another in 2023. The magazine won the National Magazine Award for General Excellence in 2022 and 2023. Mr. Goldberg is also the moderator of PBS’s “Washington Week With The Atlantic.”\\nThe magazine has been controlled by the Emerson Collective, an organization run by Laurene Powell Jobs, since it acquired a majority stake in 2017. Last year, The Atlantic announced that it was profitable and had more than one million subscriptions. It increased the number of print magazines it publishes to 12 a year, up from 10.\\nRecently, Mr. Goldberg has been beefing up political coverage at The Atlantic, hiring several top journalists from The Washington Post. The Atlantic also announced that the MSNBC “Morning Joe” co-host Jonathan Lemire and the programmer Alex Reisner would be contributing writers.\\nMr. Goldberg has frequently been an antagonist to President Trump. In 2020, he reported that Mr. Trump had disparaged American military members who died during service as “losers.” In 2024, he wrote that Mr. Trump continued to have disdain for the U.S. military and had said he needed “the kind of generals that Hitler had.”\\nKatie Robertson covers the media industry for The Times.

       " Document(text='Artificial Intelligence\\n\\nThe unemployment rate for college graduates has risen faster than for other workers over the past few years. How worried should they be?\\nCredit... Mikel Jaso\\nSupported by\\nBy Noam Scheiber\\nWhen Starbucks announced last month that it was laying off more than 1,000 corporate employees, it highlighted a disturbing trend for white-collar workers: Over the past few years, they have seen a steeper rise in unemployment than other groups, and slower wage growth .\\nIt also added fuel to a debate that has preoccupied economists for much of that time: Are the recent job losses merely a temporary development? Or do they signal something more ominous and irreversible?\\nAfter sitting below 4 percent for more than two years, the overall unemployment rate has topped that threshold since May.\\nEconomists say that the job market remains strong by historical standards and that much of the recent weakening appears connected to the economic impact of the pandemic. Companies hired aggressively amid surging demand, then shifted to layoffs once the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates. Many of these companies have sought to make their operations leaner under pressure from investors.\\nBut amid rapid advances in artificial intelligence and President Trump’s targeting of federal agencies, which disproportionately support white-collar jobs, some wonder if a permanent decline for knowledge work has begun.\\n“We’re seeing a meaningful transition in the way work is done in the white-collar world,” said Carl Tannenbaum, the chief economist of Northern Trust. “I tell people a wave is coming.”\\nTo date, few industries epitomize the shift of the last few years better than the making of video games, which began a boom in 2020 as couch-bound Americans sought out new forms of home entertainment. The industry hired aggressively before reversing course and embarking on a period of layoffs. Thousands of video-game workers lost jobs last year and the year before.\\nThe scale of the job loss was such that the host of the Game Developers Choice Awards , the industry’s annual awards show, complained about “record layoffs” during her opening monologue in 2024. That same year, a unionization trend that had begun with lower-paid quality assurance testers spread to better-paid workers like game producers, designers and engineers at companies that make the hit games Fallout and World of Warcraft .\\nAt Bethesda Game Studios, which is owned by Microsoft and makes Fallout, workers said they unionized partly because they were alarmed by rounds of layoffs at the company in 2023 and 2024 and felt that a union would give them leverage in a softening labor market.\\n“It was the first time that Bethesda had experienced layoffs in a very, very long time,” said Taylor Welling, a producer at the studio, who holds a master’s degree in interactive entertainment. “That sort of scared a lot of people.” Microsoft declined to comment.\\nUnemployment in finance and related industries , while still low, increased by about a quarter from 2022 to 2024, as rising interest rates slowed demand for mortgages and companies sought to become leaner. On an earnings call last summer, the chief executive of Wells Fargo noted that the company’s “efficiency initiatives” had pruned the company’s work force for 16 straight quarters, including a nearly 50 percent reduction of workers in the company’s home lending division since 2023.\\nLast fall, Wells Fargo laid off about one-quarter of the roughly 45 employees on its conduct management intake team, which reviews accusations of company misconduct against customers and employees. Heather Rolfes, a lawyer who was let go, said that she believed the company was seeking to save money by shrinking its U.S. work force, and that she and her colleagues were a tempting target because they had recently sought to unionize.\\n“I think it was great for them to get rid of two birds with one stone,” Ms. Rolfes said. Some of her former co-workers say they anxiously await every Tuesday after a payday, because that’s when the company tends to inform workers about job cuts. “We feel like at any moment we could be laid off,” said Eden Davis, another worker on the team.\\nA Wells Fargo spokesman said in a statement that the layoffs had nothing to do with the union and that “we regularly review and adjust staffing levels to align with market conditions.” He noted that two managers on the team had also lost their jobs.\\nAtif Rafiq, the author of a book on corporate strategy who has held senior positions at McDonald’s and Amazon, said many companies were seeking to emulate Amazon’s model of building cross-functional teams that reduce barriers between workers with different expertise, like coding and marketing. In the process, they may discover redundancies and undertake layoffs.\\nIn a memo announcing the layoffs at Starbucks last month, Brian Niccol, the chief executive, cited a goal of “removing layers and duplication and creating smaller, more nimble teams.” Nissan offered a similar rationale for management cuts announced this month.\\nOverall, the latest data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York show that the unemployment rate for college grads has risen 30 percent since bottoming out in September 2022 (to 2.6 percent from 2 percent), versus about 18 percent for all workers (to 4 percent from 3.4 percent). An analysis by Julia Pollak, chief economist of ZipRecruiter, shows that unemployment has been most elevated among those with bachelor’s degrees or some college but no degree, while unemployment has been steady or falling at the very top and bottom of the education ladder — for those with advanced degrees or without a high school diploma.\\nHiring rates have slowed more for jobs requiring a college degree than for other jobs, according to ADP Research , which studies the labor market.\\nSome economists say these trends may be short term in nature and little cause for concern on their own. Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard, noted that the uptick in unemployment for college-educated workers was only modestly larger than the increase in unemployment overall, and that unemployment for both groups remained low by historical measures.\\nProfessor Katz argued that slower growth in wages for upper-middle-class workers could simply reflect a discount that these workers effectively accepted in return for being able to work from home. Data from the liberal Economic Policy Institute shows that wages for workers in the 70th and 80th percentiles of the income distribution have grown more slowly than those of any other group since 2019.\\nBut there are other signs that the returns on a college degree may have shifted over a longer period. The gap in wages between those with a college degree and those without one grew steadily beginning in 1980, but flattened during the past 15 years, though it remains high.\\nThe flattening may partly reflect the fact that there are more college-educated workers for employers to choose from, as college attendance has increased. But some economists argue that it reflects employers’ reduced need for college graduates — for example, fewer jobs like bookkeeping as information technology has become more sophisticated. Such jobs don’t necessarily require a college degree but were often attractive to graduates because they once paid them a relatively high wage.\\nAnd artificial intelligence could reduce that need further by increasing the automation of white-collar jobs. A recent academic paper found that software developers who used an A.I. coding assistant improved a key measure of productivity by more than 25 percent, and that the productivity gains appeared to be largest among the least experienced developers. The result suggested that adopting A.I. could reduce the wage premium enjoyed by more experienced coders, since it would erode their productivity advantages over novices.\\nMert Demirer, an M.I.T. economist who was a co-author of the paper, said in an interview that a software developer’s job could change over the longer term, so that the human coder became a kind of project manager overseeing multiple A.I. assistants. In that case, wages could rise as the human became more productive. And A.I. could end up expanding employment among coders if cheaper software led to even greater demand.\\nStill, at least in the near term, many tech executives and their investors appear to see A.I. as a way to trim their staffing . A software engineer at a large tech company who declined to be named for fear of harming his job prospects said that his team was about half the size it was last year and that he and his co-workers were expected to do roughly the same amount of work by relying on an A.I. assistant. Overall, the unemployment rate in tech and related industries jumped by more than half from 2022 to 2024, to 4.4 percent from 2.9 percent.\\nThen there are Mr. Trump’s attempts to remake the federal government, which have so far resulted in job losses and hiring freezes for federal employees and employees at universities and other nonprofits that rely on government funding. Johns Hopkins University, which relies heavily on federal research funding, announced this month that it was laying off 2,000 workers worldwide as a result of Mr. Trump’s cuts.\\nProfessor Katz of Harvard noted that a larger portion of college-educated workers depended on the federal government for their jobs than other groups, either directly or through the funding of nonprofits. “What appears to be a major contraction of spending on science and research, on education, by the government — that is going to potentially have a very large impact,” he said.\\n“The overall unemployment rate for college graduates doesn’t look particularly elevated,” he added. “But it may be in the next six months.”\\nNoam Scheiber\\xa0is a Times reporter covering white-collar workers, focusing on issues such as pay, artificial intelligence, downward mobility and discrimination.

       " Document(text=\"Advertisement\\nSupported by\\nSilicon Valley is losing one of its most visible, outspoken and powerful women. Any gains have been incremental at best.\\nBy Cecilia Kang and Erin Griffith\\nCecilia Kang reported this article from Washington, and Erin Griffith from Woodside, Calif.\\nWhen Sheryl Sandberg said this week that she was resigning as chief operating officer of Meta, she also reflected on her legacy as a woman in tech.\\n“I’m especially proud that this is a company where many, many exceptional women and people from diverse backgrounds have risen through our ranks and become leaders — both in our company and in leadership roles elsewhere,” she wrote in an announcement posted on her Facebook and Instagram pages.\\nYet even as Ms. Sandberg lauded the progress of women at Meta, the broader reality for female leaders at the top of the tech industry has been far more disappointing. And with her exit this fall, Silicon Valley is losing one of its most visible and outspoken female executives, leaving few — some would say zero — similar peers in her wake.\\nMs. Sandberg, 52, was part of a cohort of women at major tech companies who made keynote speeches, rose to the level of founders like Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg, and had a seat at the table at high-powered business gatherings like the Allen & Company conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. But over the years, many of these women — including Marissa Mayer of Yahoo, Meg Whitman of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Ginni Rometty of IBM — have departed, often with their reputations in tatters.\\nMore broadly, women have not made notable gains in recent years in the highest echelons of Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta and other tech giants where the corridors of power continue to be dominated by men. The industry’s record on female leadership trails that of other industries, even as tech exerts more influence in the global economy and in people’s lives.\\n“The C.E.O. is the face of the company,” and in the tech industry, “somehow collectively the world seems to want the face to be a white man,” said Jenny Lefcourt, co-founder of All Raise, a nonprofit focused on advancing gender and racial equality, and an investor at Freestyle Capital.\\nAt Silicon Valley’s top 150 firms by revenue, 4.8 percent were led by women at the end of 2020, unchanged from 2018, according to a report by the law firm Fenwick & West. In contrast, the percentage of female chief executives of companies in the S&P 500 index rose to 6 percent at the end of 2020 from 4.8 percent in 2018.\\nSome women in positions of power at publicly traded tech companies, such as Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s general counsel, have become targets of harassment. Others, such as Françoise Brougher, a former chief operating officer of Pinterest, have sued for discrimination . And in recent years, female tech leaders have often appeared to be hired to clean up someone else’s mess , leading to the term “ glass cliff ,” a play on “glass ceiling” and a reference to the high risks of the roles.\\nSome women now in charge of public tech companies include Safra Catz of Oracle, Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices and Sarah Friar of Nextdoor, though they have tended to be more private than Ms. Sandberg.\\nAlphabet, which owns Google, and Microsoft also have women in their executive suites, such as their chief financial officers (Ruth Porat at Alphabet, Amy Hood at Microsoft), and those heading up business units, including Susan Wojcicki at YouTube. A generation of tech start-ups are also led by women, such as Melanie Perkins at the design software maker Canva and Fidji Simo at the delivery company Instacart.\\nBut women still face obstacles in nearly every facet of the tech ecosystem. Annual diversity reports published by Amazon , Google and Apple show incremental gains for women in leadership. Venture capital firms remain dominated by men, while female founders garner a tiny portion of funding. Stories about toxic workplaces, discrimination and harassment continue reverberating throughout Silicon Valley.\\n“If we stay at this current rate of progress, it will take way beyond our lifetimes to get to parity,” Ms. Lefcourt said. “We need exponential change from here.”\\nMs. Lefcourt attributed the minimal progress to the tech industry’s systemic unconscious biases, which she said were especially strong when risky start-ups were just beginning. She also cited the paucity of visible examples of what success looks like for women in the industry.\\nSince at least the 1930s, the biggest tech companies have been led by men. David Packard and Bill Hewlett famously founded Hewlett-Packard in a Silicon Valley garage in 1939, and chip companies such as Fairchild Semiconductor in the 1950s were spearheaded by men. Even in the 1990s, when Carly Fiorina was appointed the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, female leaders in Silicon Valley were rare.\\nIn the internet era, some women were tapped to lead, including Carol Bartz , the former Autodesk chief executive who became Yahoo’s chief executive in 2009. Other women joined start-ups like Google, which soon ballooned. When Ms. Sandberg left her job as a Google vice president for Facebook in 2008, she helped create a new archetype of an experienced female executive who was helping to professionalize start-ups founded by men. (Facebook was renamed Meta last year.)\\n“It wasn’t that she was just a C.O.O. — Mark made sure she was truly elevated in stature,” said Emilie Choi, the chief operating officer of Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, referring to Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook. Ms. Choi said she and other women in tech used Ms. Sandberg’s template to work alongside tech founders.\\nIn 2013, Ms. Sandberg published her best-selling business manifesto, “Lean In ,” which encouraged women to grab opportunities and to more aggressively seek promotions and raises.\\nThe difficulties that women faced in tech were highlighted by Ellen Pao , a venture capital investor who sued her employer, Kleiner Perkins, for discrimination in 2012. She lost the case in 2015, but the high-profile trial showed the ills of Silicon Valley’s boys club. Ms. Pao has since created Project Include, a nonprofit focused on diversity and inclusion.\\nMs. Pao said that while more people now believed women and others when they spoke up about discrimination and harassment, tech companies hadn’t done much to improve their workplaces.\\n“We don’t get many metrics on diversity and inclusion, and the ones that are shared show little progress, especially at the executive levels,” she said.\\nIn the aftermath of her trial, tech companies began releasing annual diversity reports outlining the gender and racial disparities in their workforces. Venture capital firms, many of them with only male partners, added women to their partnerships.\\nAt public tech companies, more women were named to executive jobs. Ursula Burns was elevated to Xerox’s chief executive in 2009. Ms. Mayer became Yahoo’s chief executive in 2012 after a long career at Google, while Ms. Rometty was named IBM’s chief executive that same year. In 2014, Ms. Catz became co-chief executive at Oracle. Microsoft appointed Ms. Hood chief financial officer in 2013, while Google hired Ms. Porat as chief financial officer in 2015.\\nBut many of them encountered difficulties steering aging tech companies. Of those women, only Ms. Catz, Ms. Hood and Ms. Porat remain in their roles. “The snail’s pace of progress for women leaders in Silicon Valley is worse than disappointing,” said Nicole Wong, a deputy chief technology officer for the Obama administration and a former Twitter executive. “It makes the commitments that tech leaders made around racial and gender diversity in 2014 look performative.”\\nIn 2017, stories of sexual harassment by powerful men in Silicon Valley became part of the #MeToo movement. That year, a group of female investors created All Raise.\\nIn 2018, California passed a law requiring publicly traded companies to have at least one female board director, leading to scores of women joining corporate boards. (A California judge struck down the law last month; the state has said it will appeal the ruling .) Another new law, passed last year, the Silenced No More Act , provides legal protection for people who speak publicly about discrimination or harassment they experienced at work.\\nWomen in tech have continued speaking out about unfair treatment. In 2020, Ms. Brougher reached a $22.5 million settlement with Pinterest for discrimination and retaliation. A discrimination lawsuit by Emily Kramer , a former chief marketing officer at the financial start-up Carta, is working its way through the courts.\\nThere have been some signs of progress. Over the past five years, Katrina Lake of Stitch Fix, Julie Wainwright of The RealReal, Jennifer Hyman of Rent the Runway and Whitney Wolfe Herd of Bumble took the companies they founded public. And following in Ms. Sandberg’s footsteps, female chief operating officers are now more common in tech. They include Ms. Choi at Coinbase, Gwynne Shotwell at SpaceX and Jen Wong at Reddit.\\nAt Meta, Ms. Sandberg hired and promoted women, such as Marne Levine, the chief business officer, and Lori Goler, the head of human resources and hiring. The percentage of women in Meta’s management with titles of director or higher increased to 35 percent in 2021, from 30 percent in 2018, according to the company’s data.\\nMeta also developed women who now lead other tech companies, including Ms. Simo, who oversaw the main Facebook app before becoming Instacart’s chief executive last year.\\n“Sheryl’s leadership has really mattered to a lot of us,” said Kate Rouch, the chief marketing officer of Coinbase, who was an employee at Meta until August.\\nBut when Ms. Sandberg leaves her job in the next few months, Javier Olivan , a longtime Meta executive, will take over the role of chief operating officer. Mr. Olivan will be one of four top deputies to Mr. Zuckerberg focused on technology and policy — and all of them are men.\\nCecilia Kang covers technology and regulation and joined The New York Times in 2015.

       " Document(text='Trump Administration\\nAdvertisement\\nThe level in the Conference Board’s latest monthly survey was the lowest since January 2021.\\nBy Danielle Kaye\\nAmericans are increasingly anxious about their jobs and finances as the Trump administration’s trade policies and government cutbacks stoke concern about the economy.\\nConsumer confidence tumbled this month to its lowest level since January 2021, the Conference Board reported on Tuesday, extending a decline that has been underway since shortly after President Trump was elected last fall. The short-term outlook for “income, business and labor market conditions” fell to its lowest reading in 12 years, the business group reported, signaling consumer angst about a deterioration in economic conditions in the coming year.\\nEconomists have warned that Mr. Trump’s plans for sweeping tariffs on the United States’ biggest trading partners could reignite inflation. Whiplash from shifting trade policies, and investors’ concern about a potential slowdown in the American economy, fueled a stock-market sell-off earlier this month. Households are bracing for higher inflation over the next year, according to the survey, with 12-month inflation expectations rising to 6.2 percent, from an outlook of 5.8 percent in February. (Over the most recent 12 months, the inflation rate was 2.8 percent, according to the Consumer Price Index for February .)\\nConsumers are “spooked” by the Trump administration’s trade wars, cuts to the federal government by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency and the recent stock market sell-off, said Bill Adams, the chief economist for Comerica Bank.\\n“When people fear for their jobs, they will cut back on discretionary spending on vacations and going out, and delay big purchases like new houses, cars or appliances,” Mr. Adams said. He added that the length of the downturn in consumer sentiment was hard to predict.\\nStephen Miran, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, played down the drop in consumer confidence in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday. “Folks often let their political views influence their views of the economy,” he said.\\nThe latest Conference Board survey added to growing evidence that uncertainty about tariff policies is making consumers less confident about the economic outlook and more worried about inflation. Data from the University of Michigan released this month showed consumer sentiment plummeting 11 percent from February as Americans of all ages, income groups and political affiliations turned even more downbeat.\\nSome company executives warn of a pullback in consumer spending, too. Delta Air Lines cut its financial forecast for the first three months of the year, citing lower demand for domestic travel, while the chief executive of the clothing retailer Burlington cautioned its investors that tariffs “could hurt discretionary spending.”\\nDanielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.

       " Document(text='Trump Administration\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nTop executives from the public media networks are bracing for a hearing on Wednesday organized by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene.\\nBy Benjamin Mullin\\nPBS is practicing answers with lawyers. NPR executives are preparing to monitor the fallout. Members of Congress are promoting the star witnesses — the leaders of the two public media networks — as if they were combatants in a prizefight.\\nThey’re all getting ready for a hearing on Wednesday — ominously titled “Anti-American Airwaves” — organized by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who leads a House subcommittee tied to Elon Musk’s efforts to cut federal spending.\\nMs. Greene said in an interview that she planned to call on the two top witnesses, Paula Kerger, the chief executive of PBS, and Katherine Maher, the chief executive of NPR, to address what she sees as liberal bias at their organizations. She also reiterated her support for defunding PBS and NPR , a move being pushed by many backers of President Trump.\\nThe executives say they are prepared to defend the work produced by their organizations and the government funding that helps support it.\\n“Everything is at stake,” Ms. Kerger said in an interview. “The future of a number of our stations across the country will be in jeopardy if this funding is not continued.”\\nEmployees of NPR and PBS, as well as supporters of the organizations, are anxiously awaiting the hearing. For more than a half-century, Republicans in Congress have sought to cut back funding for PBS and NPR, to no avail. But the threat has perhaps never been greater.\\nCongressional Republicans this year have introduced bills that would eliminate funding for public media, and Mr. Musk has publicly called for something similar from his Department of Government Efficiency, a secretive office that has taken aim at federal spending.\\nCuts from either Congress or Mr. Musk’s effort could weaken the organizations’ networks of TV and radio stations, which extend from New York City to Nome, Alaska.\\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the government-supported organization that has backed public radio and television since its creation in 1967, received $535 million from the government for this year. While the financial support that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting gives to NPR and PBS is relatively small — about 1 percent of NPR’s budget and 15 percent of PBS’s — it provides a larger proportion of funding for some of their smaller stations.\\n“As a member of the public media system, we know that federal funding is essential to ensuring all of America can hear and be heard on a truly national network,” Ms. Maher said in an email.\\nSome worry that Ms. Kerger and Ms. Maher will be subjected to the same combative interrogation that the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania faced in a hearing about campus antisemitism in 2023. Both presidents resigned not long after their testimony.\\nConservatives have been especially critical of NPR and Ms. Maher. Many have seized on an essay written a year ago by Uri Berliner, a former senior editor at NPR, who took aim at perceived left-wing bias at NPR. The essay , for The Free Press, a digital start-up, landed weeks after Ms. Maher joined NPR following a stint as the top executive of Web Summit, an organization that holds technology events around the world.\\nMs. Maher, 41, said that she had met with members of Congress over the last year to hear their concerns and that the network had put in place “measures designed to reinforce our commitment to journalism for all Americans.”\\nCritics of NPR have also zeroed in on social media posts from Ms. Maher before she joined NPR, in which she expressed support for progressive politicians and causes. They have also taken issue with a speech, delivered before she joined NPR, in which Ms. Maher said that “reverence for the truth might be a distraction.”\\nNPR said in April, when criticism of the social media posts arose, that Ms. Maher had upheld its code of ethics since her arrival. Ms. Maher said the clip from her speech “misconstrues the ideas” she was exploring “about the ways in which people use the word truth to refer to matters of belief, rather than matters of fact, and how that can be a barrier to finding common ground.” She said the talk had also affirmed “the value of truthful facts.”\\nMs. Kerger, 67, who joined PBS as its chief executive in 2006, said she was preparing for the hearing by reviewing her testimony with legal counsel. Ms. Maher told staff members last month that she was preparing with so-called murder boards, rigorous question-and-answer sessions that aim to expose potential weaknesses, and NPR’s executives are planning to monitor the hearing.\\n“I’m pretty what-you-see-is-what-you-get, and this is what I’m sure you will see at the hearing, too,” Ms. Kerger said. “But I do need to make sure that I am paying attention to the specifics so I’m as accurate as I can be.”\\nBoth PBS and NPR have taken steps to bring themselves into compliance with new rules from the Trump administration. In February, PBS closed its diversity, equity and inclusion office. Last week, NPR’s labor lawyer told its employee union that language in its contract pertaining to diversity was void.\\nNPR’s reversal on the issue is notable, in part, because D.E.I. was a linchpin of the network’s strategy under Ms. Maher’s predecessor.\\n“This was a strategy set by my predecessor,” Ms. Maher said. “I was brought in to bring a new energy, focus and ambition to our work.” She added that NPR remained “committed to supporting a diverse work force.”\\nIn the past when Congress took aim at funding for public media, station directors lobbied lawmakers in states like Alaska, where public media is one of the few options for news, entertainment and emergency warnings for residents in remote areas. And recent efforts to weaken statewide public media organizations have gone down in defeat, providing a glimmer of hope to PBS and NPR. Last week, the North Dakota Senate defeated a bill that would have banned state and federal funding for public broadcasting in a 41-to-6 vote.\\nBut PBS and NPR are also under political pressure unrelated to Congress. Brendan Carr, the new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, announced in January that his agency would investigate underwriting — paid messages similar to advertising — at NPR and PBS. That investigation is continuing.\\n“We’re in the process of accumulating all of the material for them to review,” Ms. Kerger said. “I am totally confident that we operate within the guidelines of the F.C.C., and our documentation I am sure will prove that.”\\nMs. Greene, chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency, said she expected that the hearing would address public media’s coverage of Hunter Biden’s laptop, the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia — which she called “the Russian collusion lie” — and other stories that were “left-leaning even to the point of propaganda.”\\n“I think the important thing for Americans to ask is: Is this where our taxpayer money needs to go?” she said. “To extremely left-leaning broadcasting and political bias that doesn’t represent all of America?”\\nOn social media in recent days, Ms. Greene shared a video, scored to ominous music, that included a clip from a “PBS NewsHour” story about drag queens and an NPR mic bumping Mr. Trump in the chin.\\nThe tension ahead of the hearing was encapsulated by a rally this month in front of NPR’s headquarters in Washington, featuring advocates for public media dressed up as Big Bird, Elmo and Count von Count, characters from “Sesame Street.”\\nAs the costumed advocates marched, a puppeteer from The Daily Caller, a conservative website co-founded by Tucker Carlson, began screaming questions at them.\\n“Answer me now, Elmo!” the puppeteer shouted . “Are you a globalist?”\\nBenjamin Mullin reports on the major companies behind news and entertainment.

       " Document(text='Advertisement\\nSupported by\\nOpenSea, one of the highest-profile crypto start-ups, is facing a backlash over stolen and plagiarized nonfungible tokens.\\nBy David Yaffe-Bellany\\nChris Chapman used to own one of the most valuable commodities in the crypto world: a unique digital image of a spiky-haired ape dressed in a spacesuit.\\nMr. Chapman bought the nonfungible token last year, as a widely hyped series of digital collectibles called the Bored Ape Yacht Club became a phenomenon. In December, he listed his Bored Ape for sale on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, setting the price at about $1 million. Two months later, as he got ready to take his daughters to the zoo, OpenSea sent him a notification: The ape had been sold for roughly $300,000.\\nA crypto scammer exploited a flaw in OpenSea’s system to buy the ape for significantly less than its worth, said Mr. Chapman, who runs a construction business in Texas. Last month, OpenSea offered him about $30,000 in compensation, he said, which he turned down in hopes of negotiating a larger payout.\\nThe company has made “a lot of stupid, dumb mistakes,” Mr. Chapman, 35, said. “They don’t really know what they’re doing.”\\nMr. Chapman is one of many crypto enthusiasts who have raised questions about OpenSea, an eBay-like site where people can browse millions of NFTs, buy the images and put their own up for sale. In the last 18 months, OpenSea has become the dominant NFT marketplace and one of the highest-profile crypto start-ups. The company has raised more than $400 million from investors, valuing it at a staggering $13.3 billion, and recruited executives from tech giants like Meta and Lyft .\\nBut as OpenSea has grown, it has struggled to prevent theft and fraud. The glitch that cost Mr. Chapman his ape has led to months of recriminations, forcing the start-up to make more than $6 million in payouts to NFT traders.\\nCustomers also complain that OpenSea is slow to block the sale of NFTs that were seized by hackers, who can turn a quick profit by flipping the stolen goods. And plagiarized art has proliferated on the site, outraging artists who once viewed NFTs as a financial lifeline. The company is facing at least four lawsuits from traders, and one of its former executives was indicted this month on charges related to insider trading involving NFTs.\\nOpenSea’s troubles are piling up just as demand for NFTs cools amid a crash in cryptocurrency prices. NFT sales have dropped about 90 percent since September, according to the industry data tracker NonFungible. OpenSea is also contending with competition from newer marketplaces built by established crypto companies like Coinbase.\\nThe company’s clashes with users illustrate some of the central tensions of web3 , a utopian vision of a more democratic internet controlled by regular people rather than giant tech companies. Like many crypto platforms, OpenSea does not collect the names of most of its customers and advertises itself as a “self-serve” gateway to a loosely regulated market. But users increasingly want the company to act more like a traditional business by compensating fraud victims and cracking down on theft.\\nIn three interviews, OpenSea executives acknowledged the scale of the problems and said the company was taking steps to improve trust and safety. OpenSea, which is based in New York, has hired more customer-service staff, with the aim of responding to all complaints within 24 hours. The company freezes listings of stolen NFTs and has a new screening process to prevent plagiarized content from circulating on the platform.\\n“Like every tech company, there’s a period where you’re catching up,” said Devin Finzer, 31, OpenSea’s chief executive. “You’re trying to do everything you can to accommodate the brand-new users that are coming into the space.”\\nOpenSea was founded four and a half years ago by Mr. Finzer, a Brown University graduate whose previous start-up, a personal-finance app, was sold to the financial technology company Credit Karma, and Alex Atallah, a former engineer at the software firm Palantir. They are now among the world’s richest crypto billionaires , according to Forbes.\\nTheir business model is simple. OpenSea takes a 2.5 percent cut each time an NFT is sold on its platform. Last year, business spiked as NFTs became a cultural sensation and the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies skyrocketed.\\nPractically overnight, OpenSea went from an obscure start-up to one of the most powerful middlemen in the crypto industry, which soon led to problems.\\n“It would be difficult for any company to pivot and accommodate that kind of increase so quickly,” said Carrie Presley, who worked for OpenSea for a few months last year. “It was very chaotic.”\\nBecause OpenSea collects a fee from each NFT sale, some users argue that the company has a financial incentive not to clamp down on the sale of stolen goods. This year, Robert Armijo, an investor in Nevada, sued OpenSea for failing to stop a hacker who had stolen several of his NFTs from selling one of them on the platform. (OpenSea’s lawyers called the complaint “a nonstarter” and said the company acted promptly to stop the other stolen NFTs from being sold.)\\nIn February, Eli Shapira, a former tech executive, clicked on a link that he said gave a hacker access to the digital wallet where he stores his NFTs. The thief sold two of Mr. Shapira’s most valuable NFTs on OpenSea for a total of more than $100,000.\\nWithin hours, Mr. Shapira contacted OpenSea to report the hack. But the company never took action, he said. Since then, he has used public data to track the account that seized his NFTs and has seen the hacker sell other images on OpenSea, possibly from more thefts.\\n“It’s very easy for these hackers to go and open an account there and immediately trade or sell whatever they’ve stolen,” Mr. Shapira said. “All of these guys need to step up security.”\\nLast month, after The New York Times asked OpenSea about the case, the company responded to Mr. Shapira and froze any future sales of the stolen NFTs.\\nAnne Fauvre-Willis, who oversees OpenSea’s customer-support efforts, said the company had been working to improve response times when users reported thefts.\\n“Getting faster is important,” she said. “That’s something that we are investing in today and will continue to make a huge investment on going forward.”\\nOpenSea has also seen a surge of plagiarism, as sellers convert traditional artwork into NFTs and then list the images for sale without compensating the original creator.\\nDeviantArt, an artists’ collective owned by the web-development firm Wix, runs software that scans millions of NFTs every day to detect images plagiarized from the work of its artists. The program has identified more than 290,000 instances of plagiarism on OpenSea and other NFT marketplaces.\\n“There is almost no kind of accountability,” said Liat Karpel Gurwicz, DeviantArt’s chief marketing officer.\\nOpenSea offers a tool that lets people create NFTs with a few clicks, converting regular images into unique items whose authenticity is recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain. In January, the company said it would limit the number of NFTs that users could make with the tool. But after a backlash from NFT fans, OpenSea reversed course and said in a tweet that it would eliminate the cap, even though many of the new creations had turned out to be “plagiarized works, fake collections and spam.”\\n“They’ve bastardized the concept of what NFTs were supposed to be,” said Aja Trier, an artist in Texas whose work has been copied and sold on OpenSea. “It dilutes the market for my work.”\\nIn May, OpenSea announced that it was using image-recognition technology to crack down on plagiarism. But the scanning service compares newly uploaded images only with other NFTs listed on OpenSea, making it unlikely to detect artwork plagiarized from other websites.\\nShiva Rajaraman, a former vice president at Meta and Spotify who works on OpenSea’s product team, said the company hoped to expand its anti-plagiarism dragnet. “We’ll work on partnerships with other people to get that original work,” he said.\\nMr. Chapman, a former college basketball player, started experimenting with crypto last year. He bought a Bored Ape for a few hundred dollars, and later traded it for the ape in astronaut gear because it evoked the space age history of Houston, his hometown. He started wearing a Bored Ape sweatshirt, and his mother-in-law bought him an ape-branded water bottle.\\nIn September, Mr. Chapman listed his space ape on OpenSea, setting the price at 90 Ether. Three months later, he raised the price to 269 Ether, or about $1.1 million, in line with the skyrocketing value of other Bored Ape NFTs. He was planning to sell the NFT for enough that he could immediately buy another, less valuable space ape and pocket any profits from the trade.\\nIn February, the ape sold for the original listing of 90 Ether, or roughly $300,000. Savvy traders had exploited a glitch that allowed them to activate out-of-date sales listings on OpenSea.\\nOn Feb. 18, Mr. Finzer announced that OpenSea had updated its technology to prevent thieves from reactivating old listings. The company reimbursed some victims, asking them to sign nondisclosure agreements in exchange for payouts.\\nMr. Chapman said OpenSea had initially offered him a refund of just the 2.5 percent fee it received when his space ape was sold. Last month, he said, OpenSea increased its offer to 15 Ether, or a little under $30,000 at today’s prices, after his lawyer wrote to the company. OpenSea declined to comment on his case.\\nMr. Chapman is holding out for a bigger reimbursement. As the owner of a Bored Ape NFT, he would have been entitled to a large share of ApeCoin, a cryptocurrency that was launched in March. Ape NFT owners each received a chunk of coins worth more than $100,000 at the time.\\nBecause he had lost his ape, Mr. Chapman missed out on his anticipated ApeCoin windfall, which he had planned to use to buy a house close to his wife’s family outside downtown Houston.\\n“I could have the ApeCoin right now, and have a down payment for my house,” he said. “That’s all gone.”\\nDavid Yaffe-Bellany covers cryptocurrencies and fintech.

       " Document(text='Advertisement\\nNewsletter\\nSandberg transformed digital advertising and was a voice on big issues, but she also denied problems and deflected blame.\\nBy Shira Ovide\\nIt’s not clear how history will judge Sheryl Sandberg.\\nSandberg, who said on Wednesday that she was quitting Meta after 14 years as the company’s second in command, leaves behind a complicated professional and personal legacy.\\nShe helped build the company formerly called Facebook into one of the world’s most influential and wealthy companies. Her writing and advocacy about women in the workplace and grief gave Sandberg influence on topics that few other American executives touched.\\nBut Sandberg was also partly responsible for Facebook’s failures during crucial moments, notably when the company initially denied and deflected blame for Russia-backed trolls that were abusing the site to inflame divisions among Americans ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. And while her 2013 book “ Lean In ” kicked off important conversations, some of its ideas now feel outdated.\\nAs my colleagues wrote , “Sandberg is ending her tenure at Meta far from the reputational pinnacle she reached last decade.”\\nSeveral of America’s superstar tech companies, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Oracle, have lived through relatively recent transitions in which iconic founders have handed over power to hired hands. Sandberg is not the founder of Facebook, of course. But Facebook wouldn’t be what it is today — both good and bad — without the partnership between Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg.\\nIt’s also difficult to imagine her departure significantly changing Facebook. That suggests that Sandberg’s biggest influence may have been in the past, and that she is no longer as important at Facebook as either her supporters or her detractors believe.\\nAn architect of transforming digital advertising:\\nThe 23-year-old Zuckerberg hired Sandberg in 2008 to figure out how to build Facebook into a large and lasting business. On that score, she succeeded beyond anyone’s dreams. But that legacy is complicated, too.\\nSandberg spearheaded a plan to build from scratch a more sophisticated system of advertising that was largely based on what she had helped develop at Google. Ads on Facebook were tied to people’s activities and interests on the site. As at Google, many advertisers bought Facebook ads online rather than through sales personnel, as had been typical for TV or newspaper ads. Later, Sandberg cultivated new systems for Facebook advertisers to pinpoint their potential customers with even more precision.\\nGoogle and Facebook transformed product marketing from largely an art to a sometimes creepy science, and Sandberg is among the architects of that change. She shares in the credit (or blame) for developing two of the most successful, and perhaps least defensible, business models in internet history.\\nAll the anxiety today about apps snooping on people to glean every morsel of activity to better pitch us dishwashers — that’s partly Sandberg’s doing. So are Facebook and Google’s combined $325 billion in annual advertising sales and those of all other online companies that make money from ads.\\nThe pattern of deny, deflect, defend.\\nSandberg initially said publicly that Facebook played little role in the organizing of the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. That wasn’t quite true. As my colleagues Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang reported , people used Facebook to spread misinformation about election fraud, which fueled anger among the protesters. Some rioters used Facebook to openly discuss the logistics of the attack ahead of time.\\nIn their 2021 book, “An Ugly Truth,” Sheera and Cecilia wrote that to Sandberg’s detractors, her response was part of a pattern of trying to preserve the company’s reputation or her own rather than do the right thing.\\nSandberg was also among those responsible for Facebook’s delayed or insufficient initial response in 2018 about news reports that a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, was able to harvest personal information on many millions of Facebook users.\\nTech journalists and others who pay close attention to Facebook regularly asked in recent years why Sandberg chose to stay at the company. My colleague Mike Issac said in today’s DealBook newsletter that Sandberg lost influence as Zuckerberg assumed more command over the company. Other executives took over duties that once were Sandberg’s , including overseeing government policy.\\nSandberg may have once believed that she could do far more good in the world working at Facebook than she could outside the company, but it was difficult to tell if that was true anymore.\\nIf you don’t already get this newsletter in your inbox, please sign up here .\\nTip of the Week\\nBrian X.

       " Document(text='Trump Administration\\nAdvertisement\\nThe lawsuit accuses the news site of knowingly publishing false information about how much Chris LaCivita, a Trump campaign manager, was paid by the campaign.\\nBy Katie Robertson and David Enrich\\nOne of President Trump’s former campaign managers, Chris LaCivita, on Monday filed a defamation lawsuit against The Daily Beast over its reporting on how much he was paid by the campaign.\\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, accuses The Daily Beast of creating “the false impression that Mr. LaCivita was personally profiting excessively from his work on the campaign and that he was prioritizing personal gain over the campaign’s success.”\\nIt centers on an article published Oct. 15, 2024, with the headline: “Trump In Cash Crisis-As Campaign Chief’s $22m Pay Revealed.” The article was written by Michael Isikoff, a freelance journalist, who was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.\\nThe article stated that Mr. LaCivita, a manager of Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign, had negotiated a series of contracts and was paid millions of dollars over two years from the campaign. The allegations were repeated in several follow-up articles and discussed on a Daily Beast podcast.\\nAccording to the complaint, Mr. LaCivita’s lawyers on Nov. 5 demanded a correction and a retraction, saying public records from the Federal Election Commission conflicted with statements in the article.\\nThe Daily Beast corrected its article a few days after the demand by changing the amount to $19.2 million from $22 million and clarified that the funds went to Mr. LaCivita’s consulting firm rather than to him personally. The headline was modified, and an editor’s note was appended to the article.\\nAfter Mr. LaCivita’s lawyers demanded further retractions in January, The Daily Beast removed a podcast episode titled “How Has Trump’s Campaign Manager Made $22 MILLION?” from its platforms.\\nMark Geragos, a lawyer for Mr. LaCivita, said The Daily Beast “should have investigated and followed the money before publishing lies in order to get clicks and push their political agenda.”\\nThe Daily Beast said in a statement that the outlet stood by its reporting on Mr. LaCivita.\\n“His lawsuit is meritless and a transparent attempt to intimidate The Beast and silence the independent press,” the statement said. “The Beast will defend itself vigorously and looks forward to following the money to confirm where every penny flowed in LaCivita’s L.L.C.”\\nThe lawsuit is the latest recent instance of defamation and other legal actions that Mr. Trump and his allies have filed against news outlets and journalists whose coverage they claim was misleading or inaccurate.\\nMr. Trump, for example, has outstanding lawsuits against CBS News , The Des Moines Register, CNN and the group that awards the Pulitzer Prizes . Mr. Trump’s advisers have also repeatedly threatened or filed such lawsuits. As recently as Friday, Elon Musk warned that one was “inbound” after a former congressman criticized him on television.\\nThe legal actions and threats have coincided with efforts by the Trump administration to constrain mainstream news organizations. The White House has restricted The Associated Press’s access to the president. The Federal Communications Commission is investigating broadcasters. And Mr. Trump and allies like Mr. Musk have railed against news outlets and individual journalists, including by falsely claiming that they are government propaganda outfits.\\nTo win defamation lawsuits, public figures like Mr. Trump and Mr. LaCivita must prove that defendants knew that what they were writing was false or acted with reckless disregard for its accuracy. That high bar was erected in a series of Supreme Court precedents that Mr. Trump and his allies are pushing to overturn .\\nKatie Robertson covers the media industry for The Times.

       " Document(text='\\nDespite some efforts by the largest tech companies to limit the spread of hateful content, it often remains only a click or two away.\\nA memorial near the Tops grocery store in Buffalo. Credit... Kenny Holston for The New York Times\\nSupported by\\nBy Steven Lee Myers and Stuart A. Thompson\\nOn March 30, the young man accused of the mass shooting at a Tops grocery store in Buffalo surfed through a smorgasbord of racist and antisemitic websites online. On BitChute, a video sharing site known for hosting right-wing extremism, he listened to a lecture on the decline of the American middle class by a Finnish extremist. On YouTube he found a lurid video of a car driving through Black neighborhoods in Detroit.\\nOver the course of the week that followed, his online writing shows, he lingered in furtive chat rooms on Reddit and 4chan but also read articles on race in HuffPost and Medium. He watched local television news reports of gruesome crimes. He toggled between “documentaries” on extremist websites and gun tutorials on YouTube.\\nThe young man, who was indicted by a grand jury last week, has been portrayed by the authorities and some media outlets as a troubled outcast who acted alone when he killed 10 Black people in the grocery store and wounded three more. In fact, he dwelled in numerous online communities where he and others consumed and shared racist and violent content.\\nAs the number of mass shootings escalates, experts say many of the disturbing ideas that fuel the atrocities are no longer relegated to a handful of tricky-to-find dark corners of the web. More and more outlets, both fringe and mainstream, host bigoted content, often in the name of free speech. And the inability — or unwillingness — of online services to contain violent content threatens to draw more people toward hateful postings.\\nMany images and text that the young man had in his extensive writings, which included a diary and a 180-page “manifesto,” have circulated for years online. Often, they have infiltrated some of the world’s most popular sites, like Reddit and Twitter. His path to radicalization, illustrated in these documents, reveals the limits of the efforts by companies like Twitter and Google to moderate posts, images and videos that promote extremism and violence. Enough of that content remains that it can open a pipeline for users to find more extreme websites only a click or two away.\\n“ It’s quite prolific on the internet,” said Eric K. Ward, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center who is also executive director at the Western States Center, a nonprofit research organization. “It’s not just going to fall in your lap; you have to start looking for it. But once you start looking for it, the problem is that it starts to rain down on a person in abundance.”\\nThis page in the young man’s 180-page document used memes and charts to support a racist and antisemitic worldview. The page is blurred to obscure hateful imagery.\\nMany of the images were traced back to anonymous message boards , where racist images like these have circulated for years. The gunman said he was radicalized through these message boards.\\nMost of the memes, images and charts included in a 28-page section of the “manifesto” were also found on those message boards, according to a New York Times analysis using reverse image search tools.\\nMany of the images also appeared at one time in posts and comments on social networks like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, showing their online reach has occasionally gone mainstream.\\nThe Buffalo attack has renewed focus on the role that social media and other websites continue to play in acts of violent extremism, with criticism coming from the public as well as government officials.\\n“The fact that this act of barbarism, this execution of innocent human beings, could be livestreamed on social media platforms and not taken down within a second says to me that there is a responsibility out there,” Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York said after the shooting in Buffalo. Four days later the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, announced that she had begun an investigation into the role the platforms played.\\nFacebook pointed to its rules and policies that prohibit hateful content. In a statement, a spokeswoman said the platform detects over 96 percent of content tied to hate organizations before it is reported. Twitter declined to comment. Some of the social media posts on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit that The New York Times identified through reverse image searches were deleted; some of the accounts that shared the images were suspended.\\nThe man charged in the killings, Payton Gendron, 18, detailed his attack on Discord, a chat app that emerged from the video game world in 2015, and streamed it live on Twitch, which Amazon owns. The company managed to take down his video within two minutes, but many of the sources of disinformation he cited remain online even now.\\nHis paper trail provides a chilling glimpse into how he prepared a deadly assault online, culling tips on weaponry and tactics and finding inspiration in fellow racists and previous attacks that he largely mimicked with his own. Altogether, the content formed a twisted and racist view of reality. The gunman considered the ideas to be an alternative to mainstream views.\\n“How does one prevent a shooter like me you ask?” he wrote on Discord in April, more than a month before the shooting. “The only way is to prevent them from learning the truth.”\\nHis writings map in detail the websites that motivated him. Much of the information he cobbled together in his writings involved links or images he had cherry-picked to match his racist views, reflecting the kind of online life he lived.\\nBy his own account, the young man’s radicalization began not long after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, when he was largely restricted to his home like millions of other Americans. He described getting his news mostly from Reddit before joining 4chan, the online message board. He followed topics on guns and the outdoors before finding another devoted to politics, ultimately settling in a place that allowed a toxic mélange of racist and extremist disinformation.\\nAlthough he frequented sites like 4chan known to be on the fringes, he also spent considerable time on mainstream sites, according to his own record, especially YouTube, where he found graphic scenes from police cameras and videos describing gun tips and tricks. As the day of the attack neared, the gunman watched more YouTube videos about mass shootings and police officers engaged in gunfights.\\nLinks posted to the accused gunman’s online diary show he spent months researching guns and equipment on YouTube and other websites, while viewing content on fringe websites and browsing Reddit.\\nLinks by\\nwebsite\\nDec. 2021\\nJan. 2022\\nFeb.\\nMarch\\nApril\\nMay\\nYouTube\\nGuns and\\nequipment\\nBlog post about\\ngun malfunctions\\nOnline store for\\nbody armor\\nFringe site\\nor hateful\\ncontent\\nVideo of an assault,\\ndescribed as a “white hate crime”\\nVideo about a\\nmass shooter\\nOther\\nReddit\\nPost about\\ngun malfunctions\\nPhoto of the\\nN.Y.

Three videos were removed because they linked to websites that violated YouTube’s firearms policy, which “prohibits content intended to instruct viewers how to make firearms, manufacture accessories that convert a firearm to automatic fire, or livestreaming content that shows someone handling a firearm,” according to Jack Malon, a YouTube spokesman.\\nThe shooter watched a number of videos devoted to guns and shooting practices as he recorded activity in his diary.

It was Mr. Camus , a socialist turned far-right populist, who popularized the term “le grand remplacement” in a novel by that name in 2011.\\nMr. Gendron, according to the documents he posted, seemed to have read none of those; instead he attributed the “great replacement” notion to the online writings posted by the gunman who murdered 51 Muslims at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019.\\nAfter that attack, New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, spearheaded an international pact, called the Christchurch Call , that saw government and major tech companies commit to eliminate terrorist and extremist content online. Though the agreement carried no legal penalties, the Trump administration refused to sign , citing the principle of free speech.\\nMr. Gendron’s experience online shows that the writings and video clips associated with the Christchurch shooting remain available to inspire other acts of racially motivated violence. He referred to both repeatedly.\\nThe Anti-Defamation League warned last year that the “great replacement” had moved from the fringes of white supremacist beliefs toward the mainstream, pointing to the chants of protesters at the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va., that erupted in violence and the commentaries of Tucker Carlson on Fox News.\\n“Most of us don’t know the original story,” Mr. Ward of the Southern Poverty Law Center said. “What we know is the narrative, and the narrative of the great replacement theory has been credentialized by elected officials and personalities to such an extent that the origins of the story no longer need to be told. People are beginning to just understand it as if they might understand conventional wisdom. And that’s what is frightening.”\\nFor all the efforts some major social media platforms have made to moderate content online, the algorithms they use — often meant to show users posts that they will read, watch and click — can accelerate the spread of disinformation and other harmful content.\\nMedia Matters for America, a liberal-leaning nonprofit, said last month that its researchers found at least 50 ads on Facebook over the last two years promoting aspects of the “great replacement” and related themes. Many of the ads came from candidates for political office, even though the company, now known as Meta, announced in 2019 that it would bar white nationalist and white separatist content from Facebook and Instagram.\\nThe organization’s researchers also found that 907 posts on the same themes on right-wing sites drew more 1.5 million engagements, far more than posts intended to debunk them.\\nAlthough Mr. Gendron’s video of the shooting was removed from Twitch, it resurfaced on 4chan, even while he was still at the scene of the crime. The video has since spread to other fringe platforms like Gab and ultimately mainstream platforms like Twitter, Reddit and Facebook.\\nThe advent of social media has in a fairly short period of time enabled nefarious ideas and conspiracies that once simmered in relative isolation to proliferate through society, bringing together people animated by hate, said Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters for America.\\n“They’re not isolated anymore,” he said. “They’ve been connected.”\\nSteven Lee Myers covers misinformation for The Times.

       " Document(text='Signal Leak\\nAdvertisement\\nNewsletter\\nRevelations that President Trump’s inner circle discussed sensitive military details on Signal has jolted Washington. What comes next could also be closely watched by Wall Street.\\nBy Andrew Ross Sorkin Ravi Mattu Bernhard Warner Sarah Kessler Michael J. de la Merced Lauren Hirsch and Edmund Lee\\nFollow live updates on the Trump administration’s Signal war plans leak .\\nBy far the biggest story of the day is The Atlantic’s stunning revelation that Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, discussed sensitive Yemen bombing plans with other senior Trump administration officials on a messaging app — in a group text that mistakenly included that publication’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg.\\nThe incident has raised serious questions about whether the group chat violated laws including the Espionage Act and endangered troops. But it’s also reminiscent of how Wall Street firms got into hot water for similar reasons. They had to pay more than $2 billion for doing the kind of off-channel messaging that Hegseth and others are being sharply criticized for now.\\n“We are currently clean on OPSEC,” Hegseth wrote at one point, referring to operational security, during a group chat on Signal, according to Goldberg. The defense secretary then revealed detailed war plans on the same channel. Goldberg, who had been added by Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, said he didn’t include the most sensitive details from the chat in his article.\\nWhile Goldberg writes that he was initially unsure whether the whole thing was a joke or a misinformation campaign, the launching of airstrikes on targets in Yemen eventually persuaded him that it was real. (Waltz had responded with emojis to the bombing details: “👊🇺🇸🔥”.)\\nGoldberg later left the group and confirmed with the White House that the chat was real.\\nCritics say the group chat violated laws and security protocols. It did not take place on government-vetted secure systems and it may have occurred on government officials’ phones, which have been targets of hacking by foreign adversaries.\\nMoreover, Waltz had set some of the group’s messages to disappear after one week and some after four weeks. Because they involved discussions about official acts, if they weren’t promptly forwarded to official government accounts for archiving, the participants could have run afoul of federal laws.\\nSuch accusations are similar to those that financial firms faced from regulators, which have imposed big fines for use of “off-channel” messaging services including Signal, WhatsApp and iMessage. More than two dozen institutions — including the trading app Robinhood, the lenders Wells Fargo and BNP Paribas, and others — admitted to violating record-keeping provisions of federal securities laws. (Individual bankers were also fined by their employers .)\\nThe reasons are similar: The S.E.C. and others have pushed banks to keep tabs on their employees’ messages to ensure that no laws are being broken. “Record-keeping failures such as those here undermine our ability to exercise effective regulatory oversight, often at the expense of investors,” Sanjay Wadhwa, then the S.E.C.’s deputy director of enforcement, said in 2023, announcing $289 million in fines against 11 firms.\\nWill Trump-era regulators police this going forward? Two of the S.E.C.’s current commissioners, Mark Uyeda (who’s now acting chair) and Hester Peirce, have criticized such cases because “it does not appear that firms have an achievable path to compliance .”\\nPaul Atkins, President Trump’s pick to lead the commission, feels similarly: “I’m not sure that’s the most productive or the best paradigm for an agency to follow,” he said at a Federalist Society panel last April.\\nThe F.B.I. creates a task force to investigate Tesla attacks. “ This is domestic terrorism ,” Kash Patel, the agency’s director, wrote on X in announcing the news, promising to bring those responsible for cases of vandalism or arson “to justice.” But an internal intelligence assessment by the Trump administration found that attacks on Tesla properties and vehicles probably weren’t coordinated and warned against conflating legal protests against Mr. Musk with vandalism to Teslas, The Times reports.\\nBoeing is reportedly seeking to withdraw its federal plea agreement. The embattled plane maker is hoping it can get more favorable treatment from the Justice Department under President Trump, after it pleaded guilty to deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration before two deadly crashes of 737 Max 9 jets, The Wall Street Journal reports. If the department follows suit, it would mark one of the most notable examples of a softer stance on some white-collar crime enforcement.\\nSamsung Electronics’ co-C.E.O. dies. Han Jong-Hee , who oversaw the Korean conglomerate’s smartphone and consumer businesses and was a nearly four-decade veteran of the company, died earlier on Tuesday of a heart attack, a company spokeswoman said. He was 63. His death adds to the challenges facing Samsung : Its stock has fallen more than 23 percent over the past 12 months amid questions about its A.I. chip-making and its smartphone sales.\\nFor weeks, the markets have been sending the message that American multinationals will be among the most at risk from President Trump’s trade war.\\nThat seemed apparent when the S&P 500 briefly tumbled into correction territory earlier this month. And it was clear again on Monday when stocks rallied as the White House signaled it could go easy on trading partners when it announces its next round of duties on April 2.\\nHere’s the latest:\\nTrump said on Monday that he “ may give a lot of countries breaks ,” a sign that the White House is beginning to factor in potential disruptions to global trade from its tariff policy.\\nStocks gained on Monday, with the Magnificent 7 group of tech giants posting their best one-day gain in more than two months as investors cheered the conciliatory signals.\\nThat said, it’s unclear if the Trump administration is putting much stock in the market’s ups and downs as it plots its next move. S&P 500 futures on Tuesday point to modest gains.\\nTrump has changed tack on trade policy before . Last month, the administration scrapped the so-called de minimis exception , a duty-free provision applied to goods worth up to $800. Days later it was reinstated following upheaval at customs checkpoints, and after logistics companies lobbied for relief . That experience offers a warning of potential chaos, and hopes that the administration may dial back tariff policy if it becomes too disruptive.\\n“If the elimination of de-minimis trade sowed chaos, how much more could the business cycle be disrupted if the reciprocal tariffs are rushed out before considering the downstream implications for U.S. businesses?” Tim Quinlan, a Wells Fargo economist, wrote in a research note on Monday.\\nIt wasn’t all good news on tariffs on Monday. Trump reiterated that duties on auto and pharmaceutical imports were in the works . And he threatened 25 percent tariffs on any country that bought energy from Venezuela as he increased pressure on the country’s leader, Nicolás Maduro. Those tensions put Chevron, which has a big presence in the South American country, under the gun .\\nAnd bonds sold off, with the yield on a 10-year Treasury note, which underpins mortgage and credit card lending rates, rising to a one-month high. Inflation and growth concerns are weighing on bond holders.\\nRaphael Bostic, the Atlanta Fed president, now sees the central bank cutting borrowing costs just once this year with inflation hovering well above the Fed’s 2 percent target. He added that the lack of clarity on White House policy was muddling internal Fed forecasts.\\nBusinesses have told the White House something similar, The Times’s Ana Swanson reports.\\nTheir message to Trump officials: Remove trade-war measures; don’t increase them .\\nComing into this year, deal makers were anticipating a big rebound in M.&A. and I.P.O.s.\\nWith CoreWeave expected to price this week, there’s still high hope for the latter. But deal flow is looking sluggish.\\nA look at the numbers: New research by Mergermarket, a data provider, shows that 6,955 tie-ups were announced globally this quarter, the lowest quarterly tally since 2005. Yet deal flow has roughly halved since the first quarter of 2021.\\nOn a more positive note: The aggregate value of those deals was roughly $827 billion in the first quarter — a 15 percent increase from a year earlier.\\nZooming into the United States, however, shows that deal value has sunk slightly, hurt by a dearth of megadeals. There has been a slight uptick in recent weeks — Google’s $32 billion bid for Wiz, the cybersecurity start-up, is the search giant’s biggest ever — but the underlying trend doesn’t look especially promising.\\n“While boardrooms digest the impact of tariffs and trade barriers on their businesses, dealmaking momentum has been hampered by uncertainty,” Lucinda Guthrie, Head of Mergermarket, said in a company release. “There is significant pressure for private equity firms to exit portfolio companies, especially in non-cyclical industries, and for companies to find scale and adapt to the evolving business environment.”\\nWith 23andMe filing for bankruptcy on Monday, questions are swirling about what will become of the data held by the genetic testing company.\\nThe trove is vast, consisting of data on 14 million customers’ ancestry, plus family traits and potential health risks.\\nWarnings are coming in, highlighting the potential data vulnerability. On Friday, Rob Bonta, California’s attorney general, issued a stark alert reminding constituents of their right to “delete their data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company.”\\nGeoffrey Fowler, a Washington Post tech columnist, offered a similar take . “Delete your DNA from 23andMe right now,” blared the headline in his latest column. He noted that he had spoken with privacy experts who expressed concerns about whether the company could adequately safeguard data from hackers while under bankruptcy.\\nIn 2023, the company had a data breach that targeted Jewish and Chinese customers, according to a class-action lawsuit .\\nThe company is continuing operations, including processing orders for test kits. But it said “any buyer will be required to comply with applicable law with respect to the treatment of customer data.”\\nCustomers ran into issues on Monday. Amid a rush to delete their data, many customers received error messages or reported long customer-service wait times, The Wall Street Journal reported.\\nIt has been a whirlwind for the company. After 23andMe went public in 2021, its market value briefly topped $6 billion — but it struggled to get repeat customers.\\nLast year, the seven independent directors of the board sent an open resignation letter to Anne Wojcicki, the C.E.O and founder, informing her of their frustration with the company’s direction.\\nDeals\\nGunning for dominance in China’s electric vehicle sector, BYD and Xiaomi have tapped investors for more than $11 billion in share-sale deals , the most in Hong Kong since 2021.

       " Document(text='Advertisement\\nNewsletter\\nThe court blocked a Texas law that would have forced large social media companies to publish all viewpoints.\\nBy Shira Ovide\\nThe Supreme Court handed social media companies a win on Tuesday by blocking, for now , a Texas law that would have banned large apps including Facebook and Twitter from weeding out messages based on the views they expressed.\\nBut the issue may return to the court, and at least three justices seem open to considering a question that could fundamentally change social media as we know it: Do sites like Facebook have a First Amendment right to allow some material and not others, or an obligation to distribute almost anything?\\nThe justices’ interest shows that we’re all still figuring out how to deal with a handful of social media companies having enormous influence over public conversation . Few people are happy about this reality, but it’s not clear what to do about it.\\nLet me lay out how we got here:\\nWhat the First Amendment says:\\nThe First Amendment restricts government censorship, but it doesn’t apply to decisions made by businesses.\\nYou may not agree with the internet companies’ choices, but First Amendment scholars have said that Facebook had a constitutional right to suspend the account of Donald Trump. Twitter can decree that people are not permitted to spam their followers with marketing pitches. The government has not intervened in those choices.\\nEnter Texas. And Florida.\\nConservative politicians have long complained that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media companies unfairly remove or demote some conservative viewpoints. I have not seen credible research that supports this view, but many people believe it.\\nIn response to this, a Texas law signed last year, H.B. 20, prohibited large social media companies from censoring people based on the “viewpoint of the user or another person.”\\nAssociations of internet companies and some constitutional rights groups said that the Texas law violated the First Amendment because it allowed the state to tell private businesses what kinds of speech they could or could not distribute.\\nThe internet companies went a step further and said social media apps had the same broad First Amendment protections against government interference into “editorial judgment” that apply to news organizations.\\nTexas countered that Facebook, Twitter and the like don’t have such First Amendment protections because they are more like old telegraphs, telephone companies and home internet providers. More government interference is permitted for such “common carriers” because people cannot be blocked from using essential tools of communication.\\nA majority of justices said on Tuesday that the Texas law could not go into effect while an appeal was winding its way through the court system. They did not decide on either side’s interpretation of how the First Amendment should apply to 21st-century social media.\\nWhat happens next:\\nA federal appeals court recently deemed unconstitutional a Florida law passed last year that similarly tried to restrict social media companies’ discretion over speech. The Supreme Court may eventually take up either the Texas or Florida law and make a ruling on its constitutional merits.\\nOn Tuesday and in past comments, three justices have expressed an openness to considering how the First Amendment should or shouldn’t apply to social media.\\nIn a case last year, Justice Clarence Thomas brought up the idea of social media having similar responsibilities as common carriers not to restrict speech. And on Tuesday, Thomas and Justice Neil Gorsuch signed onto a dissenting opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that said: “It is not at all obvious how our existing precedents, which predate the age of the internet, should apply to large social media companies.” Alito also wrote that he had “not formed a definitive view on the novel legal questions” brought up by the Texas social media law.\\nThese cases force us to wrestle with a fundamental question about what kind of world we want to live in: Are Facebook, Twitter and YouTube so influential in our world that the government should restrain their decisions, or are they private companies that should have the freedom to set their own rules?\\nRead more on the Texas law from our colleagues at DealBook .\\nIn this New York Times guest essay from December, Jameel Jaffer and Scott Wilkens of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University wrote that social media platforms are neither like newspapers nor like common carriers.\\nThe online trail of the accused mass killer in Buffalo: My colleagues Steven Lee Myers and Stuart A. Thompson wrote that the persistent prevalence of racist and violent material online “reveals the limits of the efforts by companies like Twitter and Google to moderate posts, images and videos that promote extremism and violence.”\\nBring back this feature from the 1990s: The old AOL Instant Messenger let people set up “away messages” that discouraged people from starting a conversation if you didn’t want to be bothered. Lauren Goode, a writer for Wired, said that it was a simple but powerful feature to free people from distractions and that she misses it.\\nA lighting assistant came to the restaurant for optimal video recording of appetizers. This Eater essay is a thoughtful reflection on how TikTok is changing the ways that we think about restaurants in both helpful and hurtful ways.\\nThe Oregon Zoo and some Girl Scouts helped release endangered pond turtles into the wild.

       " Document(text='Advertisement\\nSupported by\\nTech Tip\\nHate it or love it, your electronic inbox is still a popular point of contact and communication. Here’s how to keep it under control.\\nBy J. D. Biersdorfer\\nEmail has been known to stress out some members of Generation Z and others who favor the immediacy of chat apps over a teeming inbox . But the old electronic postal system still has its fans , who may prefer its slowness — or usefulness for composing longer messages, delivering file attachments and organizing the digital paper trail. Many apps include shortcuts to streamline the mail handling, so if you often plow through your inbox on your phone, here are a few of those timesavers for Google’s Gmail and Apple’s iOS Mail.\\nFiling or dumping messages quickly lets you take command of your inbox right away — and you can do that with your thumb, thanks to the “swipe” controls in the mail app. For example, you can assign one action (like “flag”) to a leftward swipe and pick another (like “archive”) for your rightward swipe. And Delete is always an option.\\nIn the Gmail app for Android , tap the menu icon in the upper-left corner, select Settings from the list, and choose Swipe actions. Tap the Change button to select an action for both the left and the right swipe motion. The iOS version uses different wording but similar steps.\\nTo set up your swipe actions in iOS Mail , tap the Settings icon on the iPhone’s home screen, select Mail, and then choose Swipe Options. Choose the action you want to assign to the Swipe Left and Swipe Right functions.\\nWant to delete a bunch of messages all at once? In Gmail, tap the icon next to each unwanted message in the inbox, and then tap the trash icon. In iOS Mail, tap the Edit button first, then select the messages and tap Trash in the lower-right corner of the screen.\\nYour phone’s notifications settings can tell you when new mail arrives. If you’d like a different way to peek at recent messages, you can add a mail widget to your home screen.\\nOn most phones running Android 9 or later , press an empty area of the home screen until the Widgets menu appears. Select Gmail or another mail widget you want to use, then slide it to the place on the home screen where you want it.\\nOn an iPhone running iOS 14 or later, press your finger on an empty area of the home screen (or Today screen) until the icons begin to wiggle, then tap the + button in the upper-left corner. In the Search Widgets box, enter “mail,” which brings up the option for iOS Mail — or Gmail , if you use it; note that sometimes, widgets are finicky . Make your selection, and then tap the Add Widget button on the next screen.\\nIn iOS Mail, you can also long-press the inbox preview to see more of a message and get an actions menu to reply, forward or flag it.\\nThose times when you’re waiting around for a meeting (or other event) are a good opportunity to manage your mail. Most mail apps offer several productivity features.\\nIn a new Gmail message, tap the paper clip icon at the top of the screen to add an attachment , like a photo or a file stored on your Google Drive . You can tap into the three-dot More menu on a newly received message and add it to your Google Tasks to-do list . Want to respect office hours and set a message to be sent at a later time? After you compose the text, tap the More menu in the upper-right corner of the screen and choose Schedule Send .\\nTo add an attachment in Apple’s iOS Mail app , start a new message and tap a blank area where you want to insert the file. On the toolbar that appears over the keyboard, tap the icon for the type of file you want to attach; Apple’s Mail Drop feature can send an attachment as large as 5 megabytes using its iCloud service. Tap the square icon to the right of the camera icon to scan a new document and attach it to the message. Need to annotate that file or sign a form? Tap the pen icon to mark it up onscreen by stylus or fingertip.\\nA major cause of inbox overload can be a steady flow of mailing-list messages from organizations and merchants. If you decide you no longer wish to keep reading (or deleting) these missives, scroll down to the bottom of the message and look for a link to unsubscribe or change your email preferences. Most legitimate companies include these options.\\nThe iOS Mail app often displays an Unsubscribe button at the top of a mailing-list message. Tap the button and confirm your intention to leave the list — and have your inbox get just a little more manageable.\\nJ.D.

       " Document(text=\"Advertisement\\nSupported by\\nThe longtime chief operating officer of Facebook’s parent company, Ms. Sandberg has had a lower profile during Mark Zuckerberg’s pursuit of the so-called metaverse.\\nBy Mike Isaac Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang\\nMike Isaac and Sheera Frenkel, who are based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Cecilia Kang, who is based in Washington, have covered Facebook for a combined 33 years.\\nWhen Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, recruited a Google executive named Sheryl Sandberg to his social network in 2008, he said he had hired her because “she has just about the most relevant industry experience for Facebook, especially since we need to scale our operations and scale them globally.”\\nMs. Sandberg answered in kind. “The opportunity to help another young company to grow into a global leader is the opportunity of a lifetime,” she said at the time.\\nMr. Zuckerberg was 23, and Ms. Sandberg was 38.\\nToday Mr. Zuckerberg is the same age that Ms. Sandberg was when he brought her on board, and Facebook has ballooned into a behemoth. Over the past year, Mr. Zuckerberg has begun taking the social network into a new direction — toward the immersive online world of the so-called metaverse — and renamed the company Meta . And Ms. Sandberg, 52, has increasingly lowered her profile as Mr. Zuckerberg has taken over more of her responsibilities and reorganized the company for its new chapter.\\nOn Wednesday, Ms. Sandberg said she was leaving Meta — which also owns Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger — this fall. In an interview, she said she had expected to be at the company only for roughly five years rather than the 14 she has served. She added that she planned to focus on her personal philanthropy and her foundation, Lean In, and that this summer she would marry Tom Bernthal , a television producer.\\n“I believe in this company,” said Ms. Sandberg, who will remain on Meta’s board. “Have we gotten everything right? Absolutely not. Have we learned and listened and grown and invested where we need to? This team has and will.”\\nMs. Sandberg’s decision to leave Meta was her own, and she informed Mr. Zuckerberg in a phone call over the weekend, two of her employees said. Ms. Sandberg wanted Mr. Zuckerberg, who was in Hawaii, to be the first to know, one of the people said.\\nIn a Facebook post on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg praised Ms. Sandberg, saying it was “unusual for a business partnership like ours to last so long.” He named Javier Olivan, a longtime product executive who has overseen much of Facebook’s growth over the past decade, as Meta’s next chief operating officer.\\nMs. Sandberg is ending her tenure at Meta far from the reputational pinnacle she reached last decade. A Harvard graduate who served as the chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers during the Clinton administration, she made her name in Silicon Valley by helping to build Google’s nascent targeted ads business into a multibillion-dollar juggernaut.\\nAfter joining Facebook, she developed its advertising business and was regarded as the adult in the room. Ms. Sandberg helped create some of Facebook’s advertising formats for desktop computers, before successfully building its mobile advertising strategy.\\nBy 2016, Facebook’s revenue was $27.6 billion, compared with the $153 million it generated in 2007 before Ms. Sandberg joined. The ads business remains Meta’s main financial engine.\\nMs. Sandberg’s reputation grew with the 2013 publication of her feminist business book, “ Lean In ,” a manifesto for working women based on her experience in government and business. It became a best seller and launched her personal brand, though some critics said Ms. Sandberg’s advice came from a life of privilege.\\nBut after the 2016 presidential election, Facebook faced intense scrutiny for how it was misused to stoke division and to spread misinformation. Ms. Sandberg, who was responsible for the policy and security team at the company during that election, initially ignored the issues and then delayed a public response .\\nIn 2018, the social network also became embroiled in a privacy scandal involving Cambridge Analytica , a voter-profiling firm that improperly used Facebook data. Ms. Sandberg, who was in charge of public relations, was held responsible for the fallout and muddled response on the matter.\\nThough they presented a unified front to the public, Mr. Zuckerberg grew frustrated with Ms. Sandberg’s responses to the crises. Ms. Sandberg privately told members of her staff that she didn’t agree with some of his decisions on content.\\nMr. Zuckerberg, who holds the majority of voting shares at the company, became more engaged in policy. He made final decisions on speech, including the decision in 2021 to remove President Donald J. Trump from the site after the Jan. 6 riots. He also began taking a higher public profile and over time assumed more of a role overseeing different parts of the company , some of which had been under Ms. Sandberg’s sole purview.\\nQuestions about toxic content, privacy and antitrust violations continued to dog the company, which nonetheless reached a market value of $1 trillion.\\nMs. Sandberg flirted with leaving Facebook. In 2016, she told colleagues that if Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, won the White House she would most likely assume a job in Washington, three people who spoke to her about the move at the time said. In 2018, after revelations about Cambridge Analytica and Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, she again told colleagues that she was considering leaving but did not want to do so when the company was in crisis.\\nLast year, Mr. Zuckerberg said his company was making a new bet and was going all in on the metaverse, which he called “the successor to the mobile internet.” In his announcement, Ms. Sandberg made only a cameo, while other executives were more prominently featured.\\nAs Mr. Zuckerberg overhauled the company to focus on the metaverse, some of Ms. Sandberg’s responsibilities were spread among other executives. Nick Clegg, the president of global affairs and a former British deputy prime minister, became the company’s chief spokesman, a role that Ms. Sandberg had once taken. In February, Mr. Clegg was promoted to president of global affairs for Meta.\\nMs. Sandberg’s profile dimmed.

       " Document(text='Advertisement\\nIn emails to workers at SpaceX and Tesla, Mr. Musk said they were required to spend a minimum of 40 hours a week in the office.\\nBy Ryan Mac\\nElon Musk is demanding that his workers return to the office.\\nMr. Musk, the world’s richest man, sent a pair of similar memos on Tuesday to push his employees at SpaceX, the rocket company he runs, and Tesla, the electric carmaker he leads, to spend time in the office.\\nIn his email to SpaceX employees, Mr. Musk told workers that they were required to “spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week.” Those who did not do so would be fired, he wrote in the memo, which was obtained by The New York Times.\\n“The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence,” Mr. Musk said. “That is why I spent so much time in the factory — so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, SpaceX would long ago have gone bankrupt.”\\nIn his memo to Tesla’s executive staff, which was posted by two pro-Tesla Twitter accounts and which the billionaire appeared to confirm , Mr. Musk also wrote that “anyone who wishes to do remote work” must be in the office for a minimum of 40 hours a week. Those who decline should “depart Tesla,” he added.\\nWith his twin notes, Mr. Musk waded directly into a fractious debate over the right way for corporations to bring workers back to the office during the coronavirus pandemic. Over the past couple of years, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and many other companies have announced and then delayed return-to-office dates as coronavirus surges have complicated plans. Remote work has become normalized.\\nThe issue has become more fraught as coronavirus vaccinations have increased and an abatement of the pandemic seemed to be near. Some companies began saying they expected workers to return to the office. Still, plans have continued to fluctuate. Apple last month suspended its requirement that employees return to the office in May for at least three days a week because of a resurgence of Covid-19 cases. Airbnb recently told its employees that they never had to return to the office.\\nMr. Musk, Tesla and SpaceX did not return requests for comment.\\nMany employees at Tesla and SpaceX had already been back in the office to some extent. In 2020, as “nonessential” workplaces in California closed their doors during the early days of the pandemic, SpaceX’s headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif., used its exemption as a government contractor to remain open. In a March 2020 email , which was earlier reported by BuzzFeed News, Mr. Musk told SpaceX employees that they had a higher risk of being killed in a car crash than dying from the coronavirus.\\nIn May 2020, Mr. Musk also attacked local officials in the San Francisco Bay Area for not letting him reopen Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif. Tesla sued Alameda County, where the factory is situated, and reopened it anyway, in defiance of health officials’ instructions.\\nTesla, which had more than 99,000 employees at the end of last year, has moved its headquarters to Austin, Texas, from Palo Alto, Calif., though it still has a significant manufacturing and operational presence in California. SpaceX employs about 12,000 people, Mr. Musk said in a recent interview .\\nNick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, said Mr. Musk’s directives to employees at SpaceX and Tesla were among the strictest of tech companies. Many tech companies have instead considered hybrid models in which employees can work from home for part of the time, he said.\\nMr. Bloom said he expected SpaceX and Tesla to lose about 10 percent to 20 percent of their current work forces and for recruiters to try to poach employees by offering jobs with more flexible work options.\\nMany Tesla and SpaceX employees who work in cutting-edge tech may believe in Mr. Musk, but there are also people “who are in more common activities like I.T., finance, H.R. and payroll,” Mr. Bloom said. “They may say: ‘I’m not designing cars. I’m doing the payroll of employees, and I can do that somewhere else.’”\\nAnnie Dean, the head of distributed work for Atlassian, an Australian software company, called Mr. Musk’s view “outdated.”\\n“This mind-set is regressive and discounts the last two years of collaborative, digital-first work,” said Ms. Dean, who was a former head of remote work at Meta, the owner of Facebook, in an email.\\nMr. Musk has long been known as a demanding boss. At times, he tried setting an example for hard work, taking meetings late into the night, sending emails at all hours and even sleeping at the Tesla factory to help ramp up production in 2018.\\nIt is unclear if Mr. Musk will adhere to his own rules of spending 40 hours a week in Tesla’s and SpaceX’s offices. He is rarely in the office and often travels, said two people who have worked with him and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. They expressed concerns about how the return-to-office policies would affect recruiting and retention at the companies.\\nMr. Musk is also closing a $44 billion deal to buy Twitter . He has not said what he expects of Twitter employees in terms of time spent in the office. In 2020, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive at the time, informed employees that many of them would be allowed to work from home permanently .\\nAdrian Zamora, a Twitter spokesman, said Twitter had no plans to change its policy on flexible work.\\nIn his email to SpaceX employees on Tuesday, Mr. Musk suggested that companies that didn’t require workers to return to the office would not be able to ship “a great new product.”\\n“SpaceX has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company in space,” he said. “This will not happen by phoning it in.”\\nCade Metz contributed reporting.\\nRyan Mac is a technology reporter focused on corporate accountability across the global tech industry. He won a 2020 George Polk award for his coverage of Facebook and is based in Los Angeles.

       " Document(text='Trump Administration\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nA report card from an engineering group found that American roads, ports and other infrastructure got better last year but could be hurt if federal funding is reduced.\\nBy Niraj Chokshi\\nIncreased federal spending in recent years has helped to improve U.S. ports, roads, parks, public transit and levees, according to a report released on Tuesday by the American Society of Civil Engineers.\\nBut that progress could stagnate if those investments, some of which were put on hold after President Trump took office in January, aren’t sustained.\\nOverall, the group gave the nation’s infrastructure a C grade , a mediocre rating but the best the country has received since the group’s first report card in 1998. Most infrastructure, including aviation, waterways and schools, earned a C or D grade; ports and rail did better. The group also projected a $3.7 trillion infrastructure funding shortfall over the next decade.\\n“The report card demonstrates the crucial need for the new administration and Congress to continue sustained investment in infrastructure,” Darren Olson, the chairman of the society’s committee on America’s infrastructure, said on a call with reporters. “Better infrastructure is an efficient investment of taxpayer dollars that results in a stronger economy and prioritizes American jobs.”\\nThe report, which is now released every four years, has long noted that the United States spends too little on infrastructure. But that started to change in 2021, the group said, thanks to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which authorized $1.2 trillion in funding under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. That investment is showing results, with grades having improved since the last report, in 2021, for nearly half the 18 categories that the group tracks.\\nBut in January, Mr. Trump froze much of the funding under that law and another aimed at addressing climate change, pending a review by his agencies. That halted a variety of programs , including those intended to help schools, farmers and small businesses.\\nThe engineering group expressed optimism that the federal spending would ultimately continue because it benefited most Americans and enjoyed bipartisan support.\\n“The investment levels that we saw under the last administration have really started to move the needle, and we’re looking forward to advancing that conversation as we move into this administration,” said Kristina Swallow, a former president of the group.\\nThe nation’s ports received the highest grade of any form of infrastructure, a B, indicating that they are generally safe, reliable and in good condition. Rail received a B–, a decline from its B in 2021.\\nBridges, broadband, drinking water systems, hazardous waste treatment, inland waterways, public parks and solid waste received grades of C+, C or C–, reserved for infrastructure that is in mediocre condition and needs attention. Dams, levees, roads, schools and infrastructure for aviation, energy, storm water, transit and wastewater received grades of D+ or D, indicating that they are in poor condition.\\nSome aviation infrastructure is widely considered outdated, and the Federal Aviation Administration has faced a shortage of air traffic controllers for years. Energy was the only category besides rail that received a declining grade, to D+. The group said power plants and other sources of electricity had failed to keep up with rising demand from electric vehicles and artificial intelligence.\\n“Each data center uses the same amount of energy needed to power 80,000 homes,” said Otto Lynch, an engineer who led the energy chapter of the report. “Our generation capacity has remained stagnant as new sources are merely replacing sources like coal that have been retired in recent years.”\\nNiraj Chokshi writes about aviation, rail and other transportation industries.
