Style Exposure
NVIDIA reported Jan results (revenue/EPS) above consensus estimates (and in-
line with market expectations), and off of a higher Jan-Qtr revenue base, the team
guided to a 9% Q/Q  revenue increase in the Apr-Qtr ($43B), above consensus
($42B) on continued strong spending from its customers to support their AI/
accelerated compute initiatives (both training/inference) and the continued strong
production/deployment ramp of its Blackwell datacenter platform.   Blackwell
shipments are expected to continue to ramp higher through the year and the team
remains on track to ramp its next-gen Blackwell Ultra (B300) platform in the 2H
of this year. Demand for Blackwell is very strong and will continue to outstrip
supply for several quarters. We believe the team did a good job on addressing AI
model innovations like DeepSeek and they continue to believe (as we do) that there
are multiple phases/ and innovations in models that will drive overall compute
complexity higher (test time inferencing, reinforced learning with AI/synthetic
data, agentic AI, and new model variations like WFMs, multi-modal models, etc)
and sustain the demand for more and higher performance compute infrastructure.
China sales,  we estimate, were low-teens%  (11-13%) of datacenter revenues in the
Jan-Qtr and consistent with the mix in the prior quarter, and continues to be below
its peak levels of 25%. On networking, the segment declined in the Jan-Qtr (down
3% Q/Q - expectation was for Q/Q growth) on platform mix shift (HGX/DGX
H200/B200 to NVL72  rackscale) and a higher adoption of ethernet based
networking platforms. On software, we believe the team did exit the year driving
a $2B in annualized run-rate on strong uptake of its Enterprise AI software and
Omniverse software platforms.  GM  guidance (71%)  was about 100bpts below
consensus expectations and 50bpts below our expectations and the team expects
to continue to drive a “low-70%” GM profile during an aggressive ramp phase at
least through the July-Qtr, but is expected to move higher in the 2H on higher
production yields /lower expedite fees/strong cost absorption.  Bottom line, the
team continues to maintain a 1- 2 step lead ahead of competitors with its silicon/
hardware/software platforms, and a strong ecosystem (4M CUDA software
developers) and the team is further distancing itself with its aggressive cadence of
new product launches and more product segmentation over time.  We increase our
forward estimates and maintain our PT of $170, and reiterate our OW rating.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
Investment Thesis
We believe NVIDIA continues to execute across all segments.
While 1H is typically seasonally weaker than 2H, we expect
solid demand in PC gaming to be a strong revenue driver for the
company, offsetting PC OEM, which is in secular decline. We
expect the data center segment to grow strongly as hyperscale
customers continue to embrace GPU-accelerated deep learning
for processing large data sets. We are encouraged by strength in
the automotive and enterprise segments as well, although strong
adoption of autonomous driving in the market remains to be
seen. We anticipate significant upside in the shares, driving our
Overweight rating.
Valuation
We increase our EPS estimates on better revenues stepping into
this year, partially offset by a slightly lower GM profile through
the year.  Our PT remains unchanged at $170 and assumes the
stock trades at 30-35x (33x) times $5.20 of earnings power
exiting CY25.  Our earnings multiple is consistent with its
potential earnings CAGR of 30-35%+ over the next few years
led by the continued strong datacenter growth, monetizing an
incremental ~$14B of auto revenue pipeline and incremental
software, licensing, and subscription revenues over the next
several years.

• Strong F4Q25 (Jan-Qtr) results driven by initial Blackwell production ramp
and continued strong demand for H200. NVIDIA reported F4Q25 revenue of
$39.3B (up ~12% Q/Q), above consensus ($38.25B) led by continued strong
datacenter demand, initial Blackwell production ramp ($11B in Blackwell
shipments), and continued Q/Q growth in its prior-gen H200 platform. Datacenter
revenue grew ~16% Q/Q on strong demand pull for H200 platform ramp  and $11B
in Blackwell shipments (DataCenter Compute up ~18% Q/Q). Networking, down
~3% Q/Q,  as the team transitions from NVL8 (H200/B200) Infiniband to NVL72
rackscale solutions using Spectrum X ethernet. Gaming revenues were down ~22%
Q/Q on supply constraints. Pro Vis increased ~5% Q/Q. Auto was up ~27% Q/Q on
continued ramp of its intelligent cockpit compute solutions,  autonomous platforms,
and health care applications. GM of 73.5% was in-line with consensus. EPS of $0.89
was above consensus ($0.84) on stronger revenues.
• F1Q26 (Apr-Qtr) guidance  above consensus on continued Blackwell production
ramp and start of the RTX 50-series gaming ramp.  Apr-Q revenue guidance of
$43B (up 9% Q/Q), above consensus ($42.26B) on continued production ramp of its
Blackwell platform and growth in gaming on the initial ramp of its RTX 50-series
platforms. At the midpoint, in F1Q26, the team sees Q/Q growth led by strong Q/Q
datacenter and gaming growth. GM is expected to be 71%, below consensus
(72.1%) as the team continues to scale its shipments higher and incurs expedite fees
to get systems to customers as rapidly as possible.  OpEx is guided to $3.6B. Implied
EPS is $0.93, slightly above consensus of $0.92.
• Blackwell production ramps progressing well…and the team continues to
unlock Blackwell supply; good job at addressing DeepSeek AI model
innovations…. We believe the team did a good job on addressing AI model
innovations like DeepSeek  and they continue to believe (as we do) that there are
multiple phases/ and innovations in models that will drive overall compute
complexity higher (test time inferencing, reinforced learning with AI/synthetic data,
agentic AI, and new model variations like WFMs, multi-modal models, etc.) and
sustain the demand for more and higher performance compute infrastructure.  The
team remains on track to ramp its next-gen Blackwell Ultra platform in the 2H of
this year and overall continues to be in a tight supply environment over the next
several quarters.
• Increasing forward estimates and maintaining our PT at $170. We increase our
forward estimates on higher revenues entering FY26 and maintain our PT of $170.
We remain Overweight NVDA. Our PT assumes that NVIDIA trades at a 30-35x
multiple applied to ~$5.20 of annualized earnings power exiting CY25E.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
NVIDIA Corporation (Overweight; Price Target: $170.00)
Investment Thesis
We believe NVIDIA continues to execute across all segments. While 1H is typically
seasonally weaker than 2H, we expect solid demand in PC gaming to be a strong revenue
driver for the company, offsetting PC OEM, which is in secular decline. We expect the data
center segment to grow strongly as hyperscale customers continue to embrace GPU-
accelerated deep learning for processing large data sets. We are encouraged by strength in
the automotive and enterprise segments as well, although strong adoption of autonomous
driving in the market remains to be seen. We anticipate significant upside in shares, driving
our Overweight rating.
Valuation
Our Dec-25 PT of $170 assumes that NVIDIA trades at a 30-35x (33x) multiple applied to
~$5.20 of annualized earnings power  exiting CY25E ($1.30 *4). Our earnings multiple is
consistent with its potential earnings CAGR of 30-35%+ over the next few years led by the
continued strong datacenter growth, monetizing an incremental ~$14B of auto revenue
pipeline and incremental software, licensing, and subscription revenues over the next
several years.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
• Although PC gaming demand seems resilient to macroeconomic weakness, any macro
uncertainty could weigh on PC gaming demand trends. Given NVDA’s ~53% exposure
to the PC gaming segment, any consumer PC gaming weakness poses downside risk to
our estimates.
• NVIDIA’s GPUs could gain lower than expected deployment into data center
applications as hyperscale customers further adopt deep learning as a new and effective
way of processing large unstructured data sets. Any significant decrease in the adoption
of deep learning by hyperscale customers or increase in competition could result in
downside risk to our revenue and earnings estimates.

because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
