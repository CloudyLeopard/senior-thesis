Amazon Now An Ad Giant
1. Amazon’s Fastest-Rising and Most Proﬁtable Segment? Advertising
(Bloomberg Intelligence) -- Advertising is Amazon.com's fastest-
growing revenue stream, surging at a 51% compound annual
rate from 2015-23, and could surpass $100 billion by 2027. Ads
are also likely the company's most proﬁtable segment, with
operating margins of 40-50%. The company's vertically
integrated ad platform and data from its Prime memberships position it uniquely, giving it better
targeting and attribution capabilities than competitors. Though Prime Video is starting small, highly
coveted sports content like the NFL and the NBA will support increased ad loads and higher ad
prices as viewing hours increase and engagement deepens. That could drive 20%-plus ad gains in
2025. (09/25/24)

Amazon’s $100 Billion in Ads Sets Up Triopoly With Google, Meta
Contributing Analysts Poonam Goyal (Retail)
Amazon.com's $50 billion-plus advertising revenue run rate makes it the third-largest ad platform
after Google and Meta. Levers include retail media, but Prime Video in particular sets it up for high-
teens growth into 2025 and $100 billion by 2028. Prime Video ads provide a monetization
opportunity given Amazon's big bet on live sports with the NFL and NBA. (02/19/25)
2. Amazon Theatrical Ambitions Supercharged With James Bond Deal
Contributing Analysts Kevin Near (Media)
With its purchase of creative control of the "James Bond" franchise for around $1 billion, as
reported by Deadline, Amazon/MGM is well on its way to ramping up its theatrical output. The
studio has been planning to signiﬁcantly increase the number of ﬁlms to around 16 per year by
2027 from 5-6, putting it on a level playing ﬁeld with other Hollywood majors like Warner and
Universal. This year, the studio will release "A Working Man" in March, starring Jason Statham, and
"The Accountant 2" in April with Ben Aﬄeck.
Amazon paid $8.5 billion for MGM in 2021, but was a passive partner in the artistic direction for the
Bond franchise. "James Bond" is one of the biggest movie franchises, taking in nearly $8 billion at
the global box oﬃce. The last movie “No Time to Die” came out in 2021. The next release is “Bond
26.” (02/21/25)

Amazon's Recent Theatrical Releases
3. To $100 Billion From Zero
Contributing Analysts Kevin Near (Media)
Ads are Amazon's fastest-growing business, surging to $56.2 billion revenue in 2024 vs. 2015's
$1.7 billion, or 48% compounded annual growth, getting a boost with the introduction of ads on
Prime Video. Though gains has decelerated slightly, we still expect high-teen increases, taking it to
over $100 billion by 2028. Ads are very proﬁtable, with 90% gross and 50% operating margin. A
conservative 45% margin to $56 billion in ad revenue yields $25 billion in 2024 Ebit, making it
second to Amazon Web Services' $27 billion and 25% margin.
Amazon's ad business is made up of three units: sponsored products, brands and display. In 2023,
we calculate about 90% of its ads were from retail (search and display). The rest were mostly video
ads on Prime, Fire TV, Freevee and Twitch. Sponsored ads are roughly 80-85% of the total. (02/19/25)
Amazon Advertising Revenue ($B)
4. Prime Video Will Move the Ad, Proﬁt Needle
Amazon's decision to launch ads on Prime Video was a bold move since advertisements were an
opt-out unless customers paid $2.99 a month for the ad-free version. The opt-out oﬀered
advertisers a massive reach of 115 million US viewers. In 2025, we expect Prime Video to bring in
nearly $5 billion in ads for Amazon given a solid slate of content oﬀerings including an NFL Wild-
Card playoﬀ and 66 NBA games in the 2025-26 season. Even as product search (retail media)
makes up most ads, we expect Prime Video to drive incremental upside and to fuel acceleration in
ad gains to over 20% in 2025.
The introduction of advertising also boosted Prime’s subscription revenue on the opt-out model.
Assuming 85% of US viewers watched ads suggests just over $600 million in incremental annual
subscription revenue. (09/25/24)

5. Narrowing Gap With Google, Meta
Contributing Analysts Poonam Goyal (Retail)
Amazon's advertising business has expanded quickly, becoming among the top three global
players along with Google and Meta. Yet with a 9% share of the global digital-ad market, we think
there's a lot of room to grow. The e-commerce giant has a competitive edge with its ability to close
the loop between an advertisement and purchase transaction. In a relatively concentrated US
online-ad market, Amazon has narrowed the gap with the digital duopoly with a 15% share vs.
Meta's 21% and Google's 26%. As the torchbearer for the retail-media industry, Amazon is
expected to account for 19% of US digital ads in 2025, according to Emarketer. We calculate that
at around $100 billion, Amazon could be over 25% of the market by 2027. (09/25/24)

6. Amazon Broadband Plan Trades Short-Term Pain for Long-Term Gain
Contributing Analysts Kevin Near (Media)
Amazon's plan to increase global broadband access through a constellation of over 3,000 satellites
with Project Kuiper is an ambitious initiative that will involve heavy upfront costs with the company
committing to at least a $10 billion investment. That will probably go higher. With its FCC licenses
requiring that at least half of the constellation is deployed and operational by July 2026, we expect
a sizable ﬁnancial impact to Amazon in 2025-26, creating a drag on operating income. While Kuiper
will face competition from SpaceX's Starlink, it could become proﬁtable at scale in the long run.
The satellite network will oﬀer internet speeds of up to 400 Mbps, targeting markets without well-
developed, ﬁxed or mobile broadband infrastructure. There are about 2.5 billion people globally

Dominating Retail Media
Amazon Racks Up $60 Billion in Retail Ads, Gets 35% Market Share
Amazon.com is the biggest retail media-advertising provider, with about $60 billion in 2025 ads,
accounting for 90% of its total advertising revenue and 35% of the global retail media market.
Excluding China, it makes up two-thirds of the market. With retail media among the fastest-growing
online ad categories, we think Amazon will double its retail ads to $120 billion by 2030. (03/11/25)
7. Retail Media Bedrock of Amazon Ads
Retail media, among the fastest-growing online ad channels, is the core of Amazon's ad-services
business, making up roughly 90% of total ad revenue. Retail media could generate about $50
billion in 2024 ads and $60 billion by 2025, our analysis shows, accounting for around 7% of its
gross merchandise value (GMV). By 2030, we believe the company's retail media-ad business will
double to roughly $120 billion.
The pandemic accelerated e-commerce penetration, leading to an explosion in retail-media
advertising. That, combined with the limited availability of data for targeting -- especially with new
privacy regulations -- will be a tailwind for the category, given the huge amount of rich retailer
data sets. Amazon has three main ad units on its properties: Sponsored Brands, Sponsored
Products and Sponsored Product Display ads. (03/11/25)

Retail media is a large, growing opportunity where brands can leverage a top-quality, ﬁrst-party
data trove for targeting in a safe environment with closed-loop measurement. For retailers, digital
advertising is lucrative, given its high margins (an average 50%) vs. razor-thin ones in their core
retail business, which could be as low as 2% for grocery stores. Amazon is well positioned as the

third-largest digital-ad platform after Google and Meta. Its breadth of customer purchase history
lets it close the loop between an ad and buying a product.
The biggest retail-media provider is Amazon. Excluding China, the company makes up about two-
thirds of all retail media ads, according to Magna Global. It accounts for over 75% of the $55 billion

Big Picture With Connected TV
Amazon Fights Disney for Top Connected-TV Ad Spot With NFL, NBA
Amazon.com is narrowing the connected-TV advertising gap with leading US content owner Disney
that operates Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. We calculate Amazon will more than triple its CTV-ad haul
to nearly $5 billion vs. 2023, thanks to its Prime Video ad launch. Prime beneﬁts from a large
viewer base and a low advertising cost. Sports, especially the NFL and the NBA, can supercharge
ads. (03/11/25)
9. Channeling Nearly $5 Billion in 2025
As pressures mount on linear-TV ads, the focus has shifted to CTV (video streamed on a big
screen), with elevated cord-cutting and a mass migration to streaming. US CTV-ad revenue was
about $21 billion in 2022, and we calculate it will be $29 billion in 2024 and nearly $34 billion in
2025, thanks in part to ad tiers from Netﬂix and Disney+. More importantly, Amazon turned into a
catalyst, expanding the total CTV pie with ads on Prime Video. Though Disney will be dominant via
Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+, with $5.4 billion in 2025 CTV ads, Amazon could narrow the gap with its
Prime advertising push, especially with the NBA and NFL.
CTV includes premium-video content (Hulu, Netﬂix), free-TV services (Pluto, Tubi) and user-
generated content (YouTube, TikTok). CTV is more attractive than linear because ads are easier to
target. (03/11/25)

10. Prime Push Powers Up CTV
Ads on Prime Video, which began Jan. 29 in the US, may have generated about $2 billion in
advertising revenue in 2024, based on our calculations, with a viewer base of 100 million watching
roughly 35 minutes of content a day. With about four minutes of ads an hour and a mid-$20 cost
per 1,000 impressions, monthly ad revenue could reach about $180 million.
Amazon hasn't disclosed the number of Prime Video subscribers, but said that 180 million have
used it. The company predicted an audience of 115 million at the launch of its ad tier and had 200
million monthly users in April. We assume 80-90% will stick with the ad-supported service since it's
opt-out. If 10% select the ad-free service at $2.99 a month, that would yield around $400 million in
incremental subscription revenue. (03/11/25)

11. Sports Can Be Game Changer
Contributing Analysts Kevin Near (Media)
Amazon has been steadily expanding its presence in live sports, setting it up to grab a greater
portion of the growing connected-TV ad pie. With its latest deal for NBA and WNBA games, Amazon
is home to the two most popular North American leagues: the NFL and the NBA. We calculate that
Amazon will be paying over $4 billion in 2025 for sports rights, putting it ahead of old media
companies including Fox, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery. The growing investment in sports
leaves Amazon ample room to raise advertisement loads as well as ad prices over time, especially
as viewing hours increase.
Warner Bros. Discovery has ﬁled a lawsuit against the NBA alleging that the league breached its
contract by rejecting its matching oﬀer and instead signing a deal with Amazon. (03/11/25)

12. Playing for $800 Million in NFL Ads
Though Amazon is paying around $1.4-$1.5 billion for NFL games for the 2024-2025 season, it
could easily generate around $800 million in advertising revenue. Prices for commercials during
"Thursday Night Football" cost about $440,000 for a 30-second spot in 2023, as reported by Ad
Age. With an estimated $44 million in advertising revenue per game, we calculate about $660
million in ad revenue for regular season games. Including the Black Friday game (ads selling for
$650,000-$750,000 a spot) and a wild-card game, Amazon may bring in $800 million in total ad
sales from its NFL investment.
"Thursday Night Football" averaged 11.86 million viewers per game during the 2023 season, 24%
higher vs. the 9.58 million in its ﬁrst year of streaming the games, according to Nielsen. (09/10/24)
